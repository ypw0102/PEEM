This corresponds to option E, \"Yes and yes,\" as the passage implies that Alexander did indeed accomplish this goal to some extent, as he was campaigning north at the time of the rebellion.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the rebellion occurred while Alexander was campaigning north, so it could be argued that his goal was not fully accomplished since his enemies were still active. Therefore, the more precise answer would be \"Yes, but incomplete,\" instead of \"Yes and yes.\" However, since the options do not allow for such nuance, the closest available option is \"Yes and yes,\" which is still technically correct based on the context provided.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[E]##\n\n[Note: If the options allowed for more nuanced answers, the correct answer would be \"Yes, but incomplete.\"]", "The passage discusses Alexander's actions before crossing to Asia and the rebellion of the Thebans and Athenians.

However, it is not the primary reason for the events described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are B and C.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[BC]##", "In this passage, we learn about a dispute between Alexander the Great and his father, King Philip II of Macedon, over a proposed marriage. Olympias and some of Alexander's friends believed that Philip's offer of a Carian princess's hand to Arrhidaeus, Philip's illegitimate son, indicated Philip's intention to make Arrhidaeus his heir.\n\nTo counter this, Alexander dispatched an actor named Thessalus of Corinth to persuade Pixodarus, the father of the Carian princess, to offer her hand to Alexander instead. However, when Philip learned of this, he stopped the negotiations and reprimanded Alexander for wanting to marry a Carian princess. He also punished some of Alexander's friends by exiling them and having Thessalus brought to him in chains.\n\nBased on this context, the most accurate answers are:\nB: Because they convinced Alexander that because Pixodarus offered his daughter to his half-brother, this meant that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir and Thessalus was the actor who went to Pixodarus to convince him to offer his daughter to Alexander instead\nC: He wanted a better bride for Alexander\nD: He stopped the negotiations\n\nExplanation:\nA. This is not the correct answer, as there is no mention of the friends being traitors in the passage.\n\nE. This is not the correct answer, as there is no indication in the passage that Philip wanted to punish Alexander specifically.\n\nF. This is partially correct, but it does not fully answer the question. The passage states that Philip was offering his daughter's hand to Arrhidaeus, which is why Olympias and Alexander's friends believed that Philip was making Arrhidaeus his heir. However, the question asks for the reason Philip stopped the negotiations, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. Therefore, option F is not a complete answer.\n\nB, C, and D are all mentioned in the passage and are directly related to the events described. B is the most complete answer, as it explains why Alexander sent Thessalus to Pixodarus and why Philip stopped the negotiations. C is also correct, as Philip did express a preference for a better bride for Alexander. D is also correct, as the passage states that Philip stopped the negotiations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are: B, C, and D.\n\nThe answer is:##[BCD]##", "To determine the correct answer(s) from the given options, we need to carefully analyze the provided passage and understand the context of the situation described.\n\nThe passage mentions that Olympias and Alexander's friends believed that Philip's intention of making Arrhidaeus his heir was revealed when Pixodarus offered his daughter's hand to Arrhidaeus. In response, Alexander sent an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to persuade Pixodarus to offer his daughter to Alexander instead. When Philip learned about this, he stopped the negotiations and punished Alexander by exiling four of his friends and having Thessalus brought to him in chains.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following:\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it directly relates to the central issue of the passage \u2013 the belief that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir and Alexander's subsequent actions to counter that.\n\nOption C is also a valid answer as it correctly identifies Philip's motivation for wanting a better bride for Alexander, which is mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[BC]##\n\nOptions A, D, E, and F do not directly relate to the information provided in the passage and are therefore incorrect. A suggests that the friends were traitors, but there is no evidence in the passage to support this claim. D mentions that Philip stopped the negotiations, which is true but does not provide any additional information. E suggests that Philip punished Alexander, which is also true but does not explain the reason for the punishment. F mentions that Pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, but this detail is not mentioned in the passage and is not relevant to the central issue.", "To determine the correct answer(s) based on the provided passage and options, we need to understand the context and events mentioned in the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses a conflict between Alexander and Philip regarding marriage negotiations with Pixodarus, the father of a potential bride. Olympias and some of Alexander's friends believed that Philip's willingness to offer his daughter's hand to Arrhidaeus, his illegitimate son, indicated Philip's intention to make Arrhidaeus his heir. In response, Alexander sent an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to persuade Pixodarus to offer his daughter to Alexander instead. However, Philip discovered this and stopped the negotiations, scolding Alexander for wanting to marry a Carian woman and punishing four of Alexander's friends.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answers are:\nB: Because they convinced Alexander that because Pixodarus offered his daughter to his half-brother, this meant that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir and Thessalus was the actor who went to Pixodarus to convince him to offer his daughter to Alexander instead\nD: He stopped the negotiations\nE: To punish Alexander\n\nThe passage explicitly states that Alexander's friends were punished because they convinced him of Philip's intentions regarding Arrhidaeus and helped him attempt to secure the hand of Pixodarus' daughter for himself. It also mentions that Philip stopped the negotiations as a result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:##[BE]##\n\nThe other options, such as C (He wanted a better bride for Alexander) and F (Because Pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother), are not directly related to the information provided in the passage.\n\nOption A (Because they were traitors) is incorrect as there is no mention of the friends being traitors in the passage."], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "predicts": [[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}, "key": "Wiki_articles/wikiAlexander the Great-11.txt-5"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "News/CNN/cnn-3b07f5102c69e3e609d73b2ccb0dc5549d4fbaf6.txt", "qid": "4", "passage": ["(CNN) -- Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami-Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops.", "Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns.", "A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch.", "In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers.", "The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint.", "\"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement.", "The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers.", "Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic.", "Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\"", "The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says."], "question": {"question": "What product the investigation is centered on?", "sentences_used": [3, 4], "answers": [{"text": "Amphetamines", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Drugs", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Humans", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Guns", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Narcotics", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "4", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0], "real_label": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], "single_answer": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nIn one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers.\nThe killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Amphetamines\nB: Drugs\nC: Humans\nD: Guns\nE: Narcotics\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The strength of the force applied is also an important factor in the changes in motion.\n\nOption F (The application of force) is also related to the information in the passage, as the passage states that forces cause changes in motion.\n\nOption G (Who is applying the force) is not mentioned in the passage and is not directly related to the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are: The answer is:##[DE]## or The answer is:##[DF]##", "The provided passage discusses the relationship between forces and changes in motion:\n\n1. A moving object can alter its speed and direction.\n2. Forces are responsible for causing changes in motion.\n\nGiven this context, we need to determine which options align with the information provided in the passage. The options are: A (Shape of the object), B (Mass of the object), C (The object's mass), D (The object's speed, direction, or both speed and direction), E (Strength of the force applied), F (The application of force), and G (Who is applying the force).\n\nThe passage does not mention the shape or who is applying the force, so options A and G are incorrect. The mass and the object's mass are different concepts, and the passage only mentions \"mass\" in relation to forces causing changes in motion, so option C is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that forces cause changes in motion (speed and direction), so option D is the correct answer. The strength of the force applied is mentioned in the passage as a cause of changes in motion, so option E is also a correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are: D (The object's speed, direction, or both speed and direction) and E (Strength of the force applied).\nSo, The answer is:##[DE]##", "The provided passage discusses the relationship between forces and changes in motion:\n\nThe moving object may alter its speed and/or direction.\nForces are responsible for bringing about these changes.\n\nBased on this context, we need to identify the correct answer(s) from the given options: A (Shape of the object), B (Mass of the object), C (The object's mass), D (The object's speed, direction, or both speed and direction), E (Strength of the force applied), F (The application of force), and G (Who is applying the force).\n\nThe passage does not mention the shape, mass, or who is applying the force to the object. However, the passage does discuss the object's speed and direction and the fact that forces cause changes in these aspects of motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer(s) are: D (The object's speed, direction, or both speed and direction) and F (The application of force).\n\nSo, The answer is:##[DF]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}, "key": "Science-textbook/science-g3-9.txt-3"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction/gutenberg-10002.txt", "qid": "11", "passage": ["The day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of the study candles with me on my 'round.", "By the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.", "My search had shown me nothing fresh.", "Everything appeared to be in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars.", "I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty search on the evening of the attack.", "For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated.", "I would have been very willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the cellars are the hugest and weirdest.", "Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.", "Yet, I would not shirk the work.", "I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.", "Besides, as I reassured myself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which to come across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered, only through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, I carry always on my person."], "question": {"question": "When did the person consider extinguishing the candle?", "sentences_used": [1, 3], "answers": [{"text": "Had uneventful search", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "In the cellar", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "At bed time", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Found nothing", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "As the day was just breaking", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Thought they finished searching", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "They found something interesting", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The candle got too small", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "After finishing rounds of the ground floor", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The light came back on", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "11", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [0.25, 0.5, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, 0.5, 0], "real_label": [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "single_answer": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nBy the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.\nEverything appeared to be in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Had uneventful search\nB: In the cellar\nC: At bed time\nD: Found nothing\nE: As the day was just breaking\nF: Thought they finished searching\nG: They found something interesting\nH: The candle got too small\nI: After finishing rounds of the ground floor\nJ: The light came back on\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The other options, Australia, the North Pole, and New York, are not mentioned in the passage and have varying climates that do not match the specific condition of unchanging seasons and constant average daily temperatures described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[A]##\n\nSample4:[Passages:]\nAfter the tower assigns Farnsworth and Pete their jobs , Tillie tries to help with the milk train assigned to Jebediah , but the tower insists that she is too small for the job .\nMeanwhile , Tillie asks the tower to rescue the stranded train , but he insists that Tillie will never do the job .\n\n[Options:]\nA: Two times\nB: Once\nC: Twice\nD: 1\nE: Three times\nF: 2\nG: 3\n\n[Analyses:]\n"}, "response": ["To determine the correct answer based on the given passage and options, we need to carefully analyze the text and identify any instances where the mentioned actions are repeated.\n\nThe passage states that Tillie tries to help with the milk train assigned to Jebediah but is denied by the tower due to her size. It also mentions that Tillie asks the tower to rescue a stranded train, but the tower refuses her request.\n\nHowever, the passage does not explicitly state that these actions were repeated more than once. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine if Tillie tried to help or ask for rescue more than once or if the tower denied her requests multiple times.\n\nThus, the answer is:##[B or D]##\n\nThe options do not provide enough context to determine which one is the correct answer. However, since both A and C imply that something happened twice, and the passage does not state that anything happened twice, we can eliminate options A and C.\n\nTherefore, the safest answer would be to choose either option B (once) or option D (1) as our answer.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[B or D]##\n(Note: Depending on the specific context of the passage and the other options provided, it's possible that one of these options may be more likely to be correct than the other.

So, while the answer is technically B, it may be confusing to some readers because they might interpret \"help\" as the action, rather than \"being denied\" as the action. To avoid this confusion, the question should be phrased more clearly to make it clear that the number of denials is what is being asked for.", "To determine the correct answer, we need to carefully analyze the provided passage and identify any instances where the actions mentioned correspond to the given options.\n\nThe passage describes two situations where Tillie tries to help with a job but is denied:\n1.

She asks the tower to rescue a stranded train but is told she will never do the job.\n\nHowever, the passage does not explicitly mention the number of times these events occur. To find the answer, we need to consider each option and determine if it aligns with the information given in the passage.\n\nOption A (Two times) and C (Twice) both imply that there are two instances of Tillie attempting to help with jobs. While this is true based on the description in the passage, it is important to remember that the options must be a direct match to the information provided.\n\nOption B (Once) does not align with the description in the passage as it suggests only one instance of Tillie attempting to help with a job.\n\nOptions D, E, F, and G all contain numbers that are not mentioned in the passage and are therefore not valid options.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the number of times Tillie attempts to help with jobs is C (Twice). However, it is important to note that the passage does not explicitly state that these are the only two instances of Tillie attempting to help with jobs, but rather that these are the two instances described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##\n\nIt's important to remember that the goal of these questions is to find the answer that directly aligns with the information provided in the passage, and to be cautious when considering options that may seem plausible but do not directly match the information given.", "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the provided passage and the given options carefully.\n\nThe passage states that Tillie tries to help with the milk train assigned to Jebediah but is denied the opportunity because she is considered too small for the job. Then, Tillie asks the tower to rescue a stranded train, but the tower refuses, believing that Tillie will never do the job.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that Tillie has attempted to help or take on a job twice (first with the milk train and second with the stranded train). However, she was unsuccessful in both attempts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[C]## (for options that include the number of times Tillie tried to help or take on a job)\n\nAlternatively, if we are looking for the total number of jobs mentioned in the passage, then the answer is:##[A]## (since there are two jobs mentioned: the milk train assigned to Jebediah and the stranded train).", "In this passage, there are two instances where Tillie tries to help with a job or request something from the tower.

We cannot be sure if the woman and Babette are the same person, but based on the information provided, we can confirm that there are at least four people present in the scene described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[B]##\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the possibility that the woman and Babette are the same person, then the answer would be:##[C]## with the modification that we cannot be certain if there are exactly five people in the house or not.", "In this passage, we have a description of a scene in which a man and a woman are sitting in front of a stove, and they are joined by another man who brings wine and spirits. We also have mention of Babette and the man's mother.\n\nLet's analyze the options given:\n\nA: There are only 3 people in the house\nB: There are at least 4 people in the house\nC: Five: 1. Man who came in. 2-3: Man and woman in front of a stove. 4: Babette who is standing. 5. The son. We do not know if the mother is the same person as the woman sitting in front of the stove\n\nFrom the passage, we can see that there are at least three people present: the man who comes in, the man and woman sitting in front of the stove, and Babette. The man tells Babette to get supper, suggesting that there is a mother figure in the house as well. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the woman sitting in front of the stove is the mother.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB: There are at least 4 people in the house.\n\nWhile option C is also possible, as it includes all the mentioned characters, it goes beyond the information given in the passage by making an assumption about the identity of the woman sitting in front of the stove.", "In the given passage, we have a description of a scene in which a man and a woman are sitting in front of a stove, and the man has come home and asked Babette to get supper prepared. The man and woman appear to be the parents, and the youngest son is present in the room, offering a bottle of wine and spirits. Based on this information, let's analyze the options:\n\nOption A states that there are only 3 people in the house. However, we know from the passage that there are at least the man, the woman, and Babette in the room, making a total of 3 people plus one person who has entered the house (the man who came home). Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B states that there are at least 4 people in the house. This is correct, as we have already identified the man, the woman, Babette, and the man who came home.\n\nOption C provides a list of 5 people, but we cannot be certain if the mother and the woman sitting in front of the stove are the same person or not. Based on the information given in the passage, it is not clear if there is an additional person in the house other than the ones mentioned. Therefore, option C is not a definitive answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[B]##\n\nThe answer is:##[There are at least 4 people in the house]##", "The passage describes a scene in which a man and a woman are sitting in front of a stove, and the man brings in a few things for supper. The youngest son is also present, producing two bottles. Based on this information, we can determine that there are at least three people in the house (the man who came in, the man and woman sitting in front of the stove, and the youngest son). However, we cannot be certain if the mother is the same person as the woman sitting in front of the stove. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nThe answer is:##[B]## (at least 4 people)\n\nThis answer is correct because, while we know that there are at least three people in the house, we cannot rule out the possibility that there could be more. The passage does not explicitly state that there are only three people, so the safer answer is to choose \"at least 4 people.\""], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 1], "predicts": [[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg-10020.txt-8"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Society_Law_and_Justice/oanc-Bias_on_the_Job-2.txt", "qid": "7", "passage": ["Women and minorities appear to be benefiting from greater employment opportunities in the United States, but discrimination remains a significant problem, according to a study to be released today by two professors at the Rutgers School of Law in Newark.", "The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999.", "Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms.", "The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Yes, as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry.", "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the provided passage and the given options carefully.\n\nThe passage states that Cornelius Gurlitt, a German art collector, died and left his nearly priceless collection to a Swiss museum as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. This deal resulted in some of the collection being returned to Gurlitt last month.\n\nGiven this context, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA: Yes, as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry\nThis option is correct because the passage explicitly states that the deal with the German cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry allowed for the return of part of the collection to Gurlitt last month.\n\nB: No\nThis option is incorrect because the passage states that Gurlitt did indeed leave his collection to a Swiss museum as part of the deal.\n\nC: Yes\nThis option is similar to A, but it is more general and could potentially apply to any situation where a collection is left to a museum. However, the passage specifies that the collection was left to a Swiss museum as part of a deal with the German authorities, so option A is more accurate.\n\nD: Partially\nThis option is also similar to A, but it suggests that only a part of the collection was left to the museum, while the passage states that the entire collection was left to the museum, with some pieces returned to Gurlitt as part of the deal.\n\nE: No, it was donated to the museum\nThis option is incorrect because the passage states that Gurlitt left his collection to the museum as part of a deal, not that he donated it outright.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[A]##", "Analyzing the provided passages gives us essential information about the situation regarding Cornelius Gurlitt's art collection:\n\n1. Gurlitt was a German art collector whose collection was confiscated due to suspected Nazi-looted pieces.\n2. Last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry.\n3. After Gurlitt's death, he left the masterpieces to a Swiss museum.\n\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate answer(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage. The options are: A (Yes, as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry), B (No), C (Yes), D (Partially), and E (No, it was donated to the museum).\n\nThe passage states that \"last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt,\" indicating that there was indeed a return of some pieces from the confiscated collection.

The options provided include statements that may or may not align with the information in the passage.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to consider the main idea of the passage and eliminate any options that contradict it.\n\nThe passage states that after years of isolation, Spain saw an influx of foreign influences due to increased tourism in the Balearic islands. This is described as a significant change for Spain, which had been sealed off from Europe.\n\nOption A is the most accurate, as it correctly identifies that Franco's Spain was once isolated from Europe but that foreign influences were later introduced through tourism.\n\nOption B is incorrect, as there is no mention in the passage of a lack of tourist sites in the Balearics.\n\nOption C is partially correct, but it is not mentioned in the passage that Franco rejected foreigners or that his death was a catalyst for increased tourism.\n\nOption D is correct, as it aligns with the main idea of the passage that the removal of Franco from power led to increased tourism in the Balearics.\n\nOption E is partially correct, as the passage mentions that Spain was once isolated from Europe, but it does not explicitly state that Franco led an oppressive regime.\n\nOption F is correct, as it accurately reflects the main idea of the passage that Spain was once isolated from Europe.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A, D, and F.\nThe answer is:##[ADF]##", "The passage discusses how Spain, under the rule of Franco, was once isolated from Europe, but the injection of foreign influences led to significant growth in tourism, particularly in the Balearic Islands of Mallorca and Menorca. Based on this context, the correct answer is:\n\nD: Franco had isolated Spain from Europe and once he was removed from power, other cities such as Mallorca and Menorca began to experience increases in tourism.\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage states that \"after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe,\" Spain saw an influx of foreign influences, which led to the explosive growth of tourism in Mallorca and Menorca. Additionally, it mentions that by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. The passage does not suggest that World War II encouraged tourism (A), there was no lack of tourist sites (B), Franco's death did not directly cause the increase in tourism (C), and the passage states that Franco isolated Spain from Europe (F). Therefore, the only remaining option is E, which is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[D]##", "Analyzing the provided passages, we learn about the impact of foreign

A is incorrect because Katherine is not mentioned as being a sister to anyone. B is incorrect because \"on\" is not related to Trevor as a sister. E is incorrect because there is no mention of Trevor having a sister in the passage. F is incorrect because there is no mention of Trevor having a daughter in the passage.", "The passage states that \"on\" (whose gender is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context, we can assume that \"on\" is a female clone of Katherine, the original wife of Trevor Goodchild) learns that she is a clone of Katherine and the first Katherine clone in over 400 years. It also mentions that she is sent on a mission to kill Trevor Goodchild, but during the mission, she discovers that both she and the Monicans (presumably a group of people involved in the mission) are being manipulated by council members in a secret coup.\n\nBased on this information, let's analyze each option:\n\nA: Katherine Goodchild - she is a sister\nThis option is incorrect, as the passage states that \"on\" is a clone of Katherine, not her sister.\n\nB: Trevor Goodchild, her connection to him is that she is a clone of the his original wife\nThis option is correct, as the passage states that \"on\" is a clone of Katherine, who is the original wife of Trevor Goodchild.\n\nC: Katherine Goodchild -

The passage states that it was \"just a simple mixture,\" which implies that the components were not significantly different in terms of their shapes, sizes, or colors before and after the mixture was made.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C: Different LEGOs are mixed together. Although the passage does not explicitly mention LEGOs, the use of the word \"simple\" and the fact that the mixture could be separated back into its original components suggest that we are dealing with a toy or other object that can be easily identified and separated based on its shape or form.

However, the passage also mentions that it was a \"simple mixture,\" which implies that two or more substances were combined to create a new entity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Chemicals were mixed together. Since the passage does not provide enough details about the nature of the substances involved, it is not possible to determine if they were, for example, different colors, shapes, or sizes.

Option B is not directly related to the passage as it mentions planets orbiting around the sun and the moon, which is not mentioned in the passage.

Based on this information, the correct answers should align with the description of gravity as an invisible force that pulls objects.\n\nOptions A, C, D, G, J, and H are all either incorrect or redundant. Option A is incorrect because gravity is not always a push force, but rather a pull force. Option C is redundant because the passage already states that gravity is a force. Option D is incorrect because gravity does not move things on its own, but rather causes things to move when it pulls them. Option G is incorrect because gravity does not only cause things to fall, but also keeps planets orbiting around the sun and the moon from flying into space. Option J is incorrect because gravity only pulls objects, not pushes them. Option H is redundant because the passage already states that gravity is invisible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are: F and I.\nThe answer is:##[FI]##", "The passage describes gravity as an invisible force that pulls objects down.

They are well-documented for their rule and are not known to have been frequently absent from Spain during this time.\n\nCharles V and Charles I, on the other hand, were monarchs who came later in the 16th and 17th centuries. Charles V ruled a vast empire that included Spain but spent much of his time outside of Spain dealing with various issues in other parts of Europe. Charles I, who reigned in the 17th century, faced significant opposition from his subjects and experienced rebellions, but the passage does not provide enough context to definitively link it to this monarch.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely answer based on the provided passage is Ferdinand or Isabella.

The text does not mention the name of the monarch directly but does mention that the monarch was a Spanish ruler. From this information, we can deduce that the monarch in question could be any of the Spanish rulers who were known to have ruled during a time when there were significant protests by the townsmen.\n\nHowever, we can narrow down the options based on historical context. During the late 15th and early 16th centuries, there were indeed significant protests by the townsmen in Spain, leading to revolts in various cities, including Madrid. This period is known as the Spanish Revolt of the Comuneros. The main figures during this time were Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, who ruled jointly as the Catholic Monarchs. However, the passage mentions that the monarch was away on a business trip during the time of the protests, which suggests that the monarch in question was not present in Spain during this time.\n\nTherefore, the monarch in question cannot be Ferdinand II or Isabella I. The other options, Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, and Charles I, are not mentioned in the passage and are therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nBased on the information in the passage and the historical context, we can deduce that the monarch in question is neither Ferdinand II nor Isabella I, and therefore the correct answer is not among the given options.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[None of the above]##\n\nor alternatively,\n\nThe answer is:##[X]## (where X represents an empty or blank option, indicating that none of the given options are correct)", "The provided passage describes a situation in which a monarch was away during a time of unrest among his subjects.

However, we can eliminate options that do not match the context provided.\n\nOption A, Holy Roman Emperor, is not a monarch of Spain.\nOption E, Charles I, was a monarch of England, not Spain.\n\nTherefore, we are left with options B, Ferdinand, and C, Isabella.

However, we know that they lived apart for five years before the divorce. Therefore, the length of their marriage is the difference between the marriage date and the divorce date, plus the five years they lived apart.\n\n1919-02-14 (Divorce date) + 5 years\n\nCalculating the difference between these dates, we get:\n\n1919: 1919, 0: 0\n1918: 365: 365\n1917: 365: 365\n1916: 365: 365\n1915: 365: 365\n1914: 366: 361\n\nTotal: 1828 days\n\nTo find the answer in years, we divide the number of days by the number of days in a year:\n\n1828 days / 365.25 days/year (approximately)\n\nThe answer is approximately 5 years and 2 months.

The speaker warns Mr. Thorndike that the judge is coming, and Mr. Thorndike responds by sitting down.\n\nFrom the passage, we can infer that the speaker's statement got Mr. Thorndike's attention and made him aware that the judge was approaching.

The options B and C do not align with the information provided in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is C: To get his attention. This is a reasonable assumption because the judge's arrival would require Mr. Thorndike's attention, and touching his sleeve could be a way to ensure that he is aware of the judge's presence.\n\nThe answer is:##[C]##", "In this sample, the passage describes an action taken by Mr. Thorndike in response to a situation:\n\n1.

Therefore, option C, \"To get his attention,\" is not the correct answer as it does not align with the information provided in the passage.\n\nThe passage does not mention Mr. Thorndike dusting off anything, so option A, \"To dust it off,\" is also not the correct answer.\n\nThe passage does not mention Mr. Thorndike pulling anyone closer, so option B, \"To pull him closer,\" is also not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D, \"To tell him the judge was coming,\" as it is the only option that aligns with the information provided in the passage.\n\nThe answer is:##[D]##", "Based on the provided passage and options, the correct answer is C: To get his attention. The passage states that Mr. Thorndike sat down after touching his sleeve and being told that the judge was coming. The action of touching his sleeve and the statement \"The judge is coming\" were likely used to get Mr. Thorndike's attention in preparation for the judge's entrance.

However, since the passage states that Albert Bandura is the most cited living psychologist, it is reasonable to assume that he is still actively contributing to the field and is likely to be relatively well-known. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would be a mistake in reporting his age, so we can assume that one of the options that is close to but not exactly his age must be incorrect.\n\nTo determine which option is incorrect, we can use the information provided in the passage to eliminate the options one by one. Since the passage states that Albert Bandura was born in 1925 and is currently the most cited living psychologist, it is unlikely that he would be 77 years old (option A) or 74 years old (options C, F, and E). Therefore, the correct answer is not among these options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[None of the above]##\n\nAlternatively, if you are looking for the closest approximation to Albert Bandura's age from the given options, option F (74) is the closest.
