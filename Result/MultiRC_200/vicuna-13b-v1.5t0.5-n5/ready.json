However, it does mention that they were involved in the plot.\n\nB. Callisthenes of Olynthus: The passage states that Callisthenes was implicated in the plot, but it doesn't provide a consensus among historians regarding his involvement.\n\nC.

$25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through. Initially, the rate for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation was $25 an hour. However, as of last week, he has increased this rate to a minimum of $50 an hour.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe new rate is $50 an hour, which corresponds to option A.\nThe old rate was $25 an hour, which is mentioned in option D.\nOptions B ($400) and C ($150) are not mentioned anywhere in the passage and are therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the raised rates and the original rates are A and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##\n\n\nSample2:\n[Passages:]\nLucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird.\nShe draws a picture of her family.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Martha\nB: Lucy\n\n[Analyses:]\nAnalyzing the provided passages gives us key information about the central figure in the narrative:\n\nLucy is identified as an eight-year-old girl.\nIt's stated that Lucy lives with her parents and a pet bird.\nLucy engages in an activity where she draws a picture of her family.\nGiven this context, the task requires selecting appropriate answers from the options A (Martha) and B (Lucy). Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage. The options are: A (The equator), B (Australia), C (North pole), and D (New York).\n\nThe passage explicitly mentions \"the equator\" as the location where the described climatic conditions apply. The other options, Australia, the North Pole, and New York, are not mentioned in the passage and have varying climates that do not match the specific condition of unchanging seasons and constant average daily temperatures described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[A]##\n\nSample4:[Passages:]\nThe U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom.\nSomething along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip.\n\n[Options:]\nA: \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip\nB: He has poorly represented us\nC: Criticized timing\nD: Smidgen of relevance\nE: Enjoys challenging values\nF: We are delighted to see him represent us\nG: Rhetorical equivalent of a dance at the prom\nH: They act embarrassed and indicate they have nothing to do with him\nI: It is unconscionable that he is supporting this country's tourism\n\n[Analyses:]\n"}, "response": ["The passage describes the U.S. State Department's response to Dennis Rodman's trips.

Option A is the closest match to the passage, as it states that the State Department has said \"this has nothing to do with us\" with every one of Rodman's trips. Option B is not supported by the passage, as it suggests poor representation, which is not mentioned. Option C is also not supported by the passage, as it refers to criticized timing, which is not mentioned. Option D suggests a small degree of relevance, which is not in line with the passage's description of the State Department's dismissive response. Option E suggests that Rodman enjoys challenging values, which is not mentioned in the passage. Option F suggests that the State Department is delighted to see Rodman represent the U.S., which is the opposite of the dismissive response described in the passage. Option G is a metaphor used in the passage to describe the State Department's response, but it does not directly state the response. Option H is a more specific version of option G, as it describes the State Department's response as being embarrassed and indicating that they have nothing to do with Rodman.

The second plot was revealed during the Central Asian campaign, and it was instigated by his own royal pages.\n\nBased on this information, we can analyze the options given and determine which ones are most likely to be correct.\n\nOption A, \"Less than two,\" does not match the information given in the passage, as we know of at least two plots against Alexander's life.\n\nOption B, \"Two that we know of,\" aligns with the information provided in the passage, as we are aware of two instances of plots against Alexander's life.\n\nOption C, \"A couple,\" is not specific enough to align with the information provided in the passage, as it does not specify the exact number of plots.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the information is B, \"Two that we know of.\"\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##", "The passage describes two instances of plots against Alexander's life, which were revealed and had consequences.\n\nThe first plot was against Alexander's life, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The passage does not provide the number of plots before this one, but it does mention that this was the first plot that was revealed.\n\nThe second plot was also against Alexander's life, and it was revealed during the Central Asian campaign. The passage states that this plot was instigated by his own royal pages.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, we can deduce the following:\n\n* There were at least two plots against Alexander's life that were revealed.\n* Philotas, one of Alexander's officers, was executed for failing to alert Alexander in the first plot.\n* The second plot was instigated by Alexander's own royal pages.\n\nNone of the options provided in the question match the information in the passage.

The protagonist wants to get a copy of the paper.\n\nBased on the passage, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that relate to the situation described. The options are: A (careless) and B (out of order).\n\nThe passage does not indicate that anyone or anything is careless. Instead, it suggests that the long-distance line is out of order, which is mentioned twice in the passage (once in the first sentence and again when the protagonist returns to the long-distance booth). The out-of-order line seems to be the primary cause of the protagonist's inability to communicate effectively and receive the information he needs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[B]##", "The given passage describes a situation where the protagonist is trying to communicate with headquarters but faces difficulties due to a storm and a malfunctioning long-distance booth.

The long-distance booth is out of order (Option B).\n2. A wire has come with details of the damage done by the storm, and the headquarters' telegram seems to have unclear details.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the information provided in the passage is: The answer is:##[B]##", "In this passage, the protagonist is facing a problem with the long-distance line being out of order.

The passage suggests that there is no help coming from headquarters, implying that the situation is serious and requires immediate attention. The protagonist's decision to get a copy of the paper suggests that he is looking for more information about the situation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it can be inferred that the protagonist is facing a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Therefore, the answer is:##[Not mentioned]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passage to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage describes a situation where the protagonist is trying to communicate with headquarters but faces difficulties due to a storm, a malfunctioning long-distance booth, and unclear details in a telegram.

The passage mentions that the long-distance booth is out of order and that a wire has come giving details of the damage done by the storm. It also suggests that there is a reason for the telegram's unclear wording and that the person needs to get a copy of the paper.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the person is facing difficulties in communication due to equipment failure and unclear messages. Option A (careless) does not fit the context of the passage as there is no indication of carelessness on anyone's part. Option B (out of order) is more relevant to the situation as the long-distance booth is out of order, but it does not fully capture the essence of the problem.\n\nThe passage implies that the person needs to obtain more information from a newspaper or other media, as they have not received clear details from headquarters.

This led to many Greeks losing sympathy for Alexander, and he eventually stopped the practice.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nAlexander adopted some Persian customs, which is mentioned in option A (Subjugate the Persians) and option F (Proskynesis).\nHe stopped the practice of proskynesis, which is mentioned in option F.\nOption B (Deify himself) is directly related to the reason for the loss of sympathy among the Greeks, as they believed Alexander was trying to deify himself through the gesture of proskynesis.\nOption C (Establish superiority) is not directly mentioned in the passage and is therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\nOption D (Impose Greek customs on the Persians) is not mentioned in the passage and is therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\nOption E (Exalt himself) is not directly mentioned in the passage, but it is implied in option B (Deify himself) as the reason for the loss of sympathy among the Greeks.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the context are A, F, and B.\nSo, The answer is:##[AFB]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]], "human": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}, "key": "Wiki_articles/wikiAlexander the Great-34.txt-14"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction/gutenberg_withoutQuotes/gutenberg-106-0.txt", "qid": "11", "passage": ["After what seemed an eternity to Tibo, they arrived at the mouth of a cave between two rocky hills.", "The opening was low and narrow.", "A few saplings bound together with strips of rawhide closed it against stray beasts.", "Bukawai removed the primitive door and pushed Tibo within.", "The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior.", "Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage.", "The floor was comparatively smooth, for the dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many feet until few inequalities remained.", "The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps he received.", "Bukawai walked as rapidly through the winding gallery as one would traverse a familiar lane by daylight.", "He knew every twist and turn as a mother knows the face of her child, and he seemed to be in a hurry.", "He jerked poor little Tibo possibly a trifle more ruthlessly than necessary even at the pace Bukawai set; but the old witch-doctor, an outcast from the society of man, diseased, shunned, hated, feared, was far from possessing an angelic temper.", "Nature had given him few of the kindlier characteristics of man, and these few Fate had eradicated entirely.", "Shrewd, cunning, cruel, vindictive, was Bukawai, the witch-doctor."], "question": {"question": "Where did the witch doctor take Tibo?", "sentences_used": [0, 10], "answers": [{"text": "To the lake", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Into a cave", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "To his living quarters", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "11", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 1, 0.25], "real_label": [0, 1, 1], "single_answer": [0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nAfter what seemed an eternity to Tibo, they arrived at the mouth of a cave between two rocky hills.\nHe jerked poor little Tibo possibly a trifle more ruthlessly than necessary even at the pace Bukawai set; but the old witch-doctor, an outcast from the society of man, diseased, shunned, hated, feared, was far from possessing an angelic temper.\n\n[Options:]\nA: To the lake\nB: Into a cave\nC: To his living quarters\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

However, this information is not mentioned in the passage and seems unrelated to the immediate situation described. Therefore, option A is not a valid answer.\n\nOption B suggests that the individual found a space suit and saved his life so far. This option is plausible, as it aligns with the context provided in the passage. The person's survival in such a situation would depend on having a proper space suit, which would allow them to withstand the conditions in space and potentially save their life.\n\nOption C suggests that the person was sucked away from the shuttle through a hole in the hull. This option is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention any such event or the person being sucked away from the shuttle. Therefore, option C is not a valid answer.\n\nOption D suggests that the person managed to save Jesse's life. This option is not mentioned in the passage and seems unrelated to the immediate situation described. Therefore, option D is not a valid answer.\n\nOption E suggests that their eyes bulged in panic and they couldn't hear. This option aligns with the passage, as it states that the occupants' eyes bulged in panic but there were no screams, implying that they couldn't hear due to the lack of air pressure.\n\nBased on the context provided in the passage and the logical inferences, the correct answer(s) are B (He found a space suit and saved his life so far) and E (Their eyes bulged in panic and they couldn't hear).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[BE]##", "The passage describes a situation where the airlocks in a shuttle failed to maintain air pressure, and the occupants did not make any sound despite their panicked expressions.

Therefore, options A, C, and D are not supported by the given information.\n\nOption B is also not directly mentioned in the passage, but it can be inferred that the person found a space suit and saved their life. This is supported by the statement \"he saved his life with his space suit.\" Option E is also not directly mentioned in the passage, but it can be inferred that the occupants' eyes bulged in panic and they couldn't hear due to the lack of air pressure.

This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.\n\nThe options presented are:\nA: Usurping the province of deities\nB: For becoming Persian\nC: For revenging himself\nD: Because of his efforts to adopt some elements of Persian dress and customs, such as the kissing of the hand, which the Greeks believed meant Alex intended to deify himself\nE: Because he thought himself a god\nF: Attempting to introduce proskynesis\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is D: Because of his efforts to adopt some elements of Persian dress and customs, such as the kissing of the hand, which the Greeks believed meant Alex intended to deify himself. This option accurately reflects the main reason for the negative reaction to Alexander's adoption of Persian customs. Option A, usurping the province of deities, is not mentioned in the passage. Option B, for becoming Persian, is partially correct, but it does not fully capture the specific reason for the negative reaction. Option C, for revenging himself, is not supported by the passage. Option E, because he thought himself a god, is not mentioned in the passage. Option F, attempting to introduce proskynesis, is a more specific option that is mentioned in the passage but is not the main reason for the negative reaction.", "The passage describes Alexander's adoption of some Persian customs and dress, including the custom of proskynesis, which was a gesture of respect shown to social superiors. The Greeks, however, viewed this gesture as a divine act and believed that Alexander was trying to deify himself by requiring it.

This suggests that the collection was not entirely returned, but only a part of it was. Therefore, option D (Partially) seems to be the most appropriate answer based on the passage.\n\nHowever, the passage does not provide sufficient information to determine the answer to option A (Yes, as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry). While it does mention the deal, it does not explicitly state whether the entire collection was returned or not. Hence, option A is not directly supported by the provided passage.\n\nOption B (No) and option C (Yes) do not align with the information provided in the passage.\n\nOption E (No, it was donated to the museum) is also not supported by the passage, as it does not state that the collection was donated to the museum.\n\nThus, based on the analysis of the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the context is: The answer is:##[D]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passage to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage states that German art collector Cornelius Gurlitt's collection was confiscated due to suspicions that it contained looted pieces by the Nazis.

Mr. Andrews had a \"pull\" that allowed the subject to be tolerated and permitted to sit among the police-court lawyers.\n\nOption A, \"because of his sponsor,\" aligns with the information in the passage. Option B, \"because he was sponsored by Mr. Andrews,\" is a slightly different phrasing but still captures the essence of the passage. Option C, \"he was with Mr. Andrews,\" does not align with the information in the passage. Option D, \"he was a banker,\" is irrelevant to the passage. Option E, \"because he was in charge,\" is also not mentioned in the passage and does not align with the information provided.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the context is A and B.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AB]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "predicts": [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}, "key": "Fiction-stories-masc-A_Wasted_Day-5.txt-5"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Sept11-reports/oanc-chapter-13.1-29.txt", "qid": "6", "passage": ["Before 9/11, the CIA did not invest in developing a robust capability to conduct paramilitary operations with U.S. personnel.", "It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training.", "The results were unsatisfactory.", "Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces.", "The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity.", "The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one.", "We believe this proposal to be consistent with it.", "Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions.", "The operation itself would be planned in common.", "The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations.", "The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome.", "We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality;

Option C is therefore not a valid answer.\n\nOption D is the most plausible answer as it aligns with the passage's main idea that Franco's isolation of Spain and the subsequent injection of foreign influences led to the growth of tourism in the Balearics, particularly Mallorca and Menorca.\n\nOption F is also supported by the passage, as it highlights Franco's isolation of Spain from the rest of Europe.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers that align with the passage's main idea are D and F.\n\nThe answer is:##[DF]##", "To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passage to determine which option(s) best align with the information presented.\n\nThe passage highlights the impact of foreign influences on Franco's once isolated Spain. It specifically mentions the injection of foreign influences and the explosive growth of tourism in Mallorca and Menorca, which made the Balearics one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations by the 1970s.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain experienced a change due to the injection of foreign influences.\n2. Tourism in Mallorca and Menorca, particularly, saw significant growth.\n3. The Balearics became one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations by the 1970s.\n\nNow, we need to compare these points with the given options:\n\nA: Franco isolated Spain, but World War II encouraged tourism - This option is not a direct match with the information in the passage.\nB: There was a lack of tourist sites - This option is not relevant to the passage's content.\nC: Franco rejected foreigners, and his death allowed tourism to increase - This option is partially correct, as the passage does mention the injection of foreign influences, but it doesn't mention Franco's death.\nD: Franco had isolated Spain from Europe and once he was removed from power, other cities such as Mallorca and Menorca began to experience increases in tourism - This option is a close match with the passage's content, as it highlights the injection of foreign influences and the growth of tourism in specific cities.\nE: Franco led an oppressive regime, and an eagerness to capitalize allowed tourism to increase - This option is not directly mentioned in the passage.\nF: Franco isolated Spain from the rest of Europe - This option is partially correct, as the passage mentions Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain, but it doesn't mention him isolating Spain from the rest of Europe.\n\nBased on the analysis, the options that align with the passage's content are D and F. However, option D is a closer match as it specifically mentions the injection of foreign influences and the growth of tourism in cities like Mallorca and Menorca.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "The passage describes the impact of Franco's isolationist policies on tourism in Spain, particularly in Mallorca and Menorca. After years of being closed off from the rest of Europe, Spain saw a significant influx of foreign influences, which contributed to the growth of tourism in the country. The Balearic Islands, including Mallorca and Menorca, experienced explosive growth in tourism, and by the 1970s, they were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations.\n\nBased on this information, we can analyze the options provided and determine which one(s) align with the passage's content:\n\nA: Franco isolated Spain, but World War II encouraged tourism - This option suggests that Franco's isolationist policies led to an increase in tourism due to World War II, which is not supported by the passage.\n\nB: There was a lack of tourist sites - This option is not mentioned in the passage and is not relevant to the context provided.\n\nC: Franco rejected foreigners, and his death allowed tourism to increase - This option suggests that Franco's death led to an increase in tourism, which is not supported by the passage.\n\nD: Franco had isolated Spain from Europe and once he was removed from power, other cities such as Mallorca and Menorca began to experience increases in tourism - This option aligns with the passage's content, as it highlights the impact of Franco's isolationist policies on tourism and the subsequent growth of tourism in cities like Mallorca and Menorca after his removal from power.\n\nE: Franco led an oppressive regime, and an eagerness to capitalize allowed tourism to increase - This option suggests that the increase in tourism was due to an eagerness to capitalize on Franco's oppressive regime, which is not supported by the passage.\n\nF: Franco isolated Spain from the rest of Europe - This option aligns with the passage's content, as it highlights the impact of Franco's isolationist policies on Spain's connection to the rest of Europe.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer that aligns with the passage's content is D.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "predicts": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0,

Option H (Security guard) is also not a good fit as the protagonist does not seem to be concerned about security, but rather reassuring themselves about the safety of the cellars.\n\nOption A (A teacher) is also unlikely as there is no indication in the passage that the protagonist is a teacher. Option B (A prince) is also not a good fit as there is no indication of royalty in the passage.\n\nOption C (A policeman) is a possibility as the protagonist mentions carrying a key on their person, which could be a key to a police station or a set of keys for a law enforcement role. However, this is not explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nOption D (A keeper) is a better fit as it aligns with the protagonist's visit to the cellars, which they seem to be responsible for keeping.

Therefore, the two posthumously published works could be \"A Happy Death\" and \"The First Man.\"\n\nGiven the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is:##[AD]##", "The passage provides information about the author's surviving family members and the publication of his works.\n\nThe author was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine.\nHis works are copyrighted by his son and daughter.\nTwo of Camus's works were published posthumously.\n\nBased on the information provided, we need to identify which of the options accurately reflects the two posthumously published works of Camus.\n\nOption A: A Happy Death and an untitled unfinished book - This option is incorrect because only two works are mentioned, and both are identified as published posthumously.\nOption B: A Happy Death (1970) and The Stranger - This option is incorrect because only two works are mentioned, and both are identified as published posthumously.\nOption C: A Happy Death and The First Man - This option is incorrect because only two works are mentioned, and both are identified as published posthumously.\nOption D: The First Man and an untitled unfinished book - This option is incorrect because only two works are mentioned, and both are identified as published posthumously.\nOption E: The Stranger and The First Man - This option is incorrect because only two works are mentioned, and both are identified as published posthumously.\nOption F: There isn't a scholarly debate about two of his books - This option is incorrect because the passage specifically states that two of Camus's works were published posthumously.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer(s) that align with the posthumously published works are A and D.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AD]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passage mentions that the author held copyrights to his work, and his survivors were his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine.

Therefore, option A (A Happy Death and an untitled unfinished book) and option D (The First Man and an untitled unfinished book) are the most plausible answers, as they allow for the possibility of two posthumously published works without specifying their titles.\n\nHowever, since the passage mentions that the author's survivors held the copyrights to his work, it is unlikely that the posthumously published works would be \"untitled unfinished book,\" as this would imply that they were not copyrighted.

Finally, option D is incorrect because the passage does not say that the mass of the object has no effect on the motion of the object when a force is applied.", "The passage describes that the motion of an object changes when a force is applied and also depends on the object's mass. We need to determine the correct answer based on this information.\n\nThe passage indicates that the relationship between the motion of an object and the force applied, as well as the object's mass, is relevant to the situation. This suggests that the answer should be related to the dependence of motion on both force and mass.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA: How much an object's motion changes when a force is applied has very little to do with the object's mass.\nB: No.\nC: Motion changes only depend on the strength of the force applied.\nD: Yes.\n\nBased on the passage, option A is incorrect because it suggests that the mass of the object has little effect on its motion when a force is applied, which is not the case.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage mentions that the motion of the object depends on both the force applied and the object's mass.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not state that motion depends only on the strength of the force applied. Instead, it emphasizes that both the force applied and the object's mass play a role in determining the motion of the object.\n\nOption D is the correct answer because it aligns with the passage's emphasis on the dependence of motion on both the force applied and the object's mass.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]], "human": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "key": "Science-textbook/science-g3-9.txt-2"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Society_Law_and_Justice/oanc-Disaster_center-2.txt", "qid": "1", "passage": ["FEMA inspectors were in Kerrville again Wednesday, inspecting some damaged homes.", "According to Lindsay, FEMA has already received 44,000 inspection requests in Texas.", "The number of individuals seeking relief from the floods across South Texas increased by more than 1,000 Tuesday, bringing the total to 5,855, he said.", "FEMA has already distributed $1.8 million in relief in the form of emergency housing.", "\"The registration process is going rapidly,\" Lindsay said, adding that most registrations took between 5 and 7 minutes.", "Aid also is available from the local chapter of the Red Cross, but flooding victims must interview with the Red Cross separately to receive aid from them, too.", "Daletta Andreas, Hill Country chapter executive director, said the chapter has received calls from people who thought registering with FEMA or for cleanup services from local groups automatically registered them for Red Cross services.", "That's incorrect, Andreas said.", "\"They need to come in and go through our interview process,\" she said.", "The Red Cross service center, 333 Earl Garrett St., is open from 9 a.m.", "to 6 p.m.", "daily, and will be open this weekend, Andreas said.", "People seeking assistance must provide identification proving they reside in the area.", "Members of the State Bar of Texas are offering free legal advice for flood victims.", "Victims in Texas counties declared a federal disaster can call (800) 504-7030 for assistance with basic legal questions.", "The free legal assistance hotline, operated in coordination with Texas Rural Legal Aid and volunteer lawyers from across the state, will be available from 8 a.m.", "to 8 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and 8 a.m.", "to 6 p.m."], "question": {"question": "Why are there damaged homes in Kerrville?", "sentences_used": [0, 2], "answers": [{"text": "Typhoon damage", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Tornadoes", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Hurricane", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Wildfires", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Flooding", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Water damage", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because of floods across South Texas", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "1", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 0.25, 0, 0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25], "real_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], "single_answer": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nFEMA inspectors were in Kerrville again Wednesday, inspecting some damaged homes.\nThe number of individuals seeking relief from the floods across South Texas increased by more than 1,000 Tuesday, bringing the total to 5,855, he said.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Typhoon damage\nB: Tornadoes\nC: Hurricane\nD: Wildfires\nE: Flooding\nF: Water damage\nG: Because of floods across South Texas\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The options are: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that General Zinni asked General Musharraf to take all action necessary, while the passage only mentions that he was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to take action.\n\nOption B is the correct answer, as it accurately represents the passage's content by specifying that General Zinni was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to \"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time.\"\n\nOption C is incorrect because it only mentions the main purpose of General Zinni's mission but does not provide the specific context of his role as the President's special envoy.\n\nOption D is not mentioned in the passage and is therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nOption E is incorrect because it states that General Zinni approached Pakistan to attack terrorists in 8 countries, while the passage only mentions his mission to ask General Musharraf to take action regarding Bin Laden.\n\nOption F is incorrect because it states that General Zinni asked General Musharraf to start arrest operations, while the passage only mentions that he was sent to ask General Musharraf to take action.\n\nOption G is not mentioned in the passage and is therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##", "The passage describes a new approach made to Pakistan, with General Anthony Zinni being designated as the President's special envoy to ask General Musharraf to take action to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time. The passage does not provide any information about General Zinni asking General Musharraf to start arrest operations or approaching Pakistan to attack terrorists in 8 countries. Therefore, options F and E are not supported by the passage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage states that General Zinni was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to take whatever action he deems necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time. Option C is a restatement of the correct answer, which is option B.\n\nOption D is not mentioned in the passage, so it is incorrect.\n\nOption G is not supported by the passage, as the passage does not mention the Taliban or al Qaeda.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[B]##", "The passage describes a new approach made to Pakistan with General Anthony Zinni as the President's special envoy.

We can do this by subtracting 510 from 753, which gives us 243 years.\n\nThe passage does not provide any direct information about the length of time between the revolt in 510 BCE and the establishment of the Roman Republic in 241 BCE. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D are not directly related to the information given in the passage.\n\nE is the only option that corresponds to the calculated difference in years between the two events mentioned in the passage. Therefore, The answer is:##[E]##", "The passage provides information about the founding date of Rome:\n\nHistorians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c.\n\nIt also mentions that Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. during the Etruscan domination.

It also mentions the period of Etruscan domination and the transition from monarchy to revolt in 510 BCE. The task is to determine the duration of the period between the two events.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the passage and identify the relevant information. The passage states that Rome was a monarchy under Etruscan domination until a revolt in 510 BCE. The passage does not provide the duration of this period explicitly. However, we can infer that the period between the founding date of 753 BCE and the revolt in 510 BCE is the duration of the monarchy under Etruscan domination.\n\nThe passage does not provide the exact duration of this period, but we can use our knowledge of historical events to estimate the duration. We know that the traditional founding date of Rome is 753 BCE, and the period of Etruscan domination lasted from the 8th to the 6th centuries BCE. Therefore, the duration of the monarchy under Etruscan domination can be estimated to be around 200 years.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is not among the options provided.

Apply force on the ball: This option is directly related to the first statement in the passage, which mentions that force can cause an object at rest to start moving.\n\nD. A force: This option is directly related to both statements in the passage, as it refers to the concept of force being responsible for both starting and stopping objects.\n\nE. Pressure: This option is not directly related to the effects of force on objects as described in the passage.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the effects of force on objects are D (A force) and C (Apply force on the ball).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[DC]##", "The passage provides information about the effects of force on objects:\n\nForce can cause an object at rest to start moving.\nForces can cause a moving object to stop.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following:\n\n1.
