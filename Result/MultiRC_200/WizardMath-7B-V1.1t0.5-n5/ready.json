However, the passages do not provide any information that directly supports this reason.\n\nOption B: Because they convinced Alexander that because Pixodarus offered his daughter to his half-brother, this meant that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir and Thessalus was the actor who went to Pixodarus to convince him to offer his daughter to Alexander instead\nThis option suggests that Philip was angry because Alexander's friends convinced him that Pixodarus's offer meant that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir.

The events mentioned include:\n\n1. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir.\n2. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander.\n3. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.\n4. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy, and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options and determine which ones are correct based on the information provided in the passages:\n\nA: Because they were traitors - This option is partially correct. Alexander's friends were exiled because they supported Alexander's decision to marry the daughter of a Carian, which Philip did not approve of. However, the primary reason for their exile was not their treason, but rather their support for Alexander's marriage choice.\n\nB: Because they convinced Alexander that because Pixodarus offered his daughter to his half-brother, this meant that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir and Thessalus was the actor who went to Pixodarus to convince him to offer his daughter to Alexander instead - This option is incorrect. Thessalus was the actor who went to Pixodarus to convince him to offer his daughter to Alexander instead, but this was not the primary reason for the exile of Alexander's friends. The primary reason was to punish Alexander for his decision to marry the daughter of a Carian, which Philip did not approve of.\n\nC: He wanted a better bride for Alexander - This option is correct. Philip exiled Alexander's friends and had Thessalus brought to him in chains because he wanted a better bride for Alexander. He did not approve of Alexander's decision to marry the daughter of a Carian.\n\nD: He stopped the negotiations - This option is correct. Philip stopped the negotiations between Pixodarus and Alexander because he did not approve of Alexander's decision to marry the daughter of a Carian.\n\nE: To punish Alexander - This option is partially correct. Philip exiled Alexander's friends and had Thessalus brought to him in chains to punish Alexander for his decision to marry the daughter of a Carian, which Philip did not approve of. However, the primary reason for the exile of Alexander's friends was not to punish Alexander, but rather to punish them for supporting Alexander's marriage choice.\n\nF: Because Pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother - This option is incorrect. The reason for the exile of Alexander's friends and the punishment of Thessalus was not because Pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, but rather because Alexander decided to marry the daughter of a Carian, which Philip did not approve of.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are: D, C.\n\nThe answer is: D, C.", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passages and select the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passages provide a historical context about the relationship between Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great.

The friends and Thessalus played a role in the events leading up to the exile of the friends and the punishment of Thessalus.\n\nOption C: \"He wanted a better bride for Alexander\"\nThis reason aligns with the information provided in the passages. Philip expressed his desire for a better bride for Alexander.\n\nOption D: \"He stopped the negotiations\"\nThis reason aligns with the information provided in the passages. Philip halted the negotiations after receiving news of Alexander's actions.\n\nOption E: \"To punish Alexander\"\nThis reason does not align with the information provided in the passages. There is no indication that Philip's actions were intended to punish Alexander.\n\nOption F: \"Because Pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother\"\nThis reason aligns with the information provided in the passages.

However, this is not mentioned in the passages, so it is not the correct reason.\n\n3. \"Only some of them were mixed up\" - This option suggests that not all of the items were mixed up, which allows for separation. This is not mentioned in the passages, so it is not the correct reason.\n\n4. \"Because they have different shapes and sizes\" - This option suggests that the items were separated based on their shapes and sizes.

This means that the substances were not transformed into a new substance, but rather their form or state was altered.\n\n2. The second step is to determine if the substances can be separated. The passage states that the substances can be separated back into order. This means that the substances did not undergo a chemical reaction, which would make them impossible to separate.\n\n3.

A physical change is a change in the appearance of a substance, but the substance itself remains the same. A chemical change, on the other hand, involves a change in the substance itself, resulting in a new substance.\n\nIn this case, the passage states that it was a physical change. This means that the substances were not chemically altered, and their original forms could be recovered.\n\nThe second part of the passage mentions that the substances could be separated back into order. This is another characteristic of a physical change.

The second sentence tells us that we are able to separate them back into order. This means that the substances can be easily distinguished and separated based on their physical properties.\n\n3. The third sentence tells us that only some of them were mixed up. This means that not all of the substances were mixed together, and some of them remained in their original state.\n\n4. The fourth sentence tells us that they have different shapes and sizes. This means that we can easily identify and separate them based on their physical characteristics.\n\n5.

The passages describe Cowboy's behavior in different emotional states: happy, hungry, and mean. \n\nNext, we need to determine which options correctly represent Cowboy's behaviors based on the passages. \n\n- Option A: Bite, chew and scratch - This option mentions biting, chewing, and scratching, but it does not specifically relate to the emotions described in the passages.\n- Option B: Happy, hungry and mean - This option correctly lists the three emotions mentioned in the passages.\n- Option C: Mean - This option only mentions one emotion, which is not a complete representation of Cowboy's behaviors.\n- Option D: Nice - This option is not mentioned in the passages and does not represent Cowboy's behaviors.\n- Option E: Happy - This option only mentions one emotion, which is not a complete representation of Cowboy's behaviors.\n- Option F: He liked to hide, chew on a soft toy and bite red tomatoes - This option mentions three behaviors, but they do not correspond to the three emotions described in the passages.\n- Option G: His three emotions were happy, Hungry and mean - This option correctly lists the three emotions mentioned in the passages, but it does not provide a complete representation of Cowboy's behaviors.\n- Option H: He usually felt either happy, hungry, or mean - This option correctly represents the three emotions mentioned in the passages, but it does

That means gravity affects all objects in the universe.", "The answer is: Universal gravitation, also known as the law of universal gravitation, is the theory formulated by Isaac Newton in 1687 to describe the attractive force between any two objects in the universe. It is the force that keeps the planets in their orbits, the moon orbiting the Earth, and even the smallest objects pulled towards each other. The law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force between any two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the greater the mass of an object, the greater its gravitational force, and the closer the objects are to each other, the stronger the gravitational force between them.

However, the passages do not directly connect World War II to the increase in tourism in Spain or the Balearic Islands.\n\nOption B suggests a lack of tourist sites as a reason for the increase in tourism. This contradicts the information in the passages, which imply that the increase in tourism was due to the influx of foreign influences and changes in government policy.\n\nOption C states that Franco rejected foreigners and that his death allowed tourism to increase. While Franco's death did contribute to the increase in tourism, the passages do not emphasize this as the primary reason for the change.\n\nOption D aligns with the information in the passages, as it mentions that Franco isolated Spain from Europe and that the increase in tourism occurred after his death. This option accurately reflects the connection between Franco's policies and the subsequent increase in tourism.\n\nOption E suggests that an eagerness to capitalize on tourism opportunities contributed to the increase in tourism. This is a possible factor, but it is not the main emphasis of the passages.\n\nOption F correctly states that Franco isolated Spain from the rest of Europe, which is consistent with the information in the passages.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answers are:\n\nThe answer is:##[D]##\nThe answer is:##[F]##\n\nThe answer is: [D, F].", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passages and determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passages provide information about the impact of Franco's regime on Spain's tourism industry.\n\nOption A: This statement is partially correct.

The big hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per hour. The little hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per hour as well.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time when the big hand is pointing to the 10 and the little hand is pointing to the 12.\n\nSince the big hand moves 30 degrees per hour, it will take 300 degrees to move from the 12 to the 10. Therefore, it will take 10 hours for the big hand to point to the 10.\n\nThe little hand is already pointing to the 12, and it moves 30 degrees per hour. To reach the 12, it has already covered 30 degrees (1/12 * 360 degrees). Therefore, it will take an additional 300 degrees to reach the 10. Thus, it will take 10 hours for the little hand to point to the 12 as well.\n\nSince both hands take 10 hours to reach the specified positions, the time when both hands are pointing to the 10 and 12 is at 10 o'clock.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[A]##.\n\nThe answer is: 10.", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passages carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passage mentions that Sam's mom and dad promised to take Sam to the beach on Sunday.

At this point, they heard a bell.\n\nThe second passage provides an explanation for why the narrator didn't hear any sound when their shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in. It states that sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nOption A: No, it was sucked away from the narrator's space suit.\nThis option suggests that the narrator heard the bell because the sound was not affected by the malfunctioning shuttle and the lack of air. However, this contradicts the information in the second passage, which states that sound cannot travel in space due to the lack of a medium. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Yes, because the shuttle malfunctioned.\nThis option suggests that the narrator heard the bell despite the shuttle malfunctioning and the lack of air.

At this moment, they hear a bell.\n\nPassage 2:\nSound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium. So, when the narrator's shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, they heard nothing.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options and determine which one is the correct answer.\n\nOption A: No, it was sucked away from the narrator's space suit\nThis option states that the sound was not heard because it was sucked away from the narrator's space suit. However, this does not align with the information provided in the passages.\n\nOption B: Yes, because the shuttle malfunctioned\nThis option states that the sound was not heard because the shuttle malfunctioned. However, the malfunctioning of the shuttle is not directly related to the sound not being heard.\n\nOption C: No, there was just a lighting and a thunder\nThis option states that the sound was not heard because there was only a lighting and a thunder. However, this does not align with the information provided in the passages.\n\nOption D: No, because the narrator heard a bell at the end\nThis option states that the sound was not heard because the narrator heard a bell at the end.

The first passage describes the narrator's experience of hearing a bell at the time when the shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in. The second passage provides an explanation about sound waves and how they travel through a medium. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the narrator heard the bell or not. According to the first passage, the narrator heard a bell at the time when the airlocks didn't keep the air in. This means that the narrator was able to hear the bell despite the shuttle malfunctioning. \n\nHowever, the second passage states that sound cannot travel in space because there is no medium for the sound waves to travel through. This contradicts the first passage, which states that the narrator heard a bell in space. \n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the narrator did not hear the bell, as sound cannot travel in space. \n\nSo, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[C]##.\n\nThe answer is: [C]."], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 0, 0]}, "key": "Fiction-stories-masc-hotel-California-0.txt-1"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction-stories-masc-A_Wasted_Day-5.txt", "qid": "0", "passage": ["Mr. Andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs.", "\"You sit there,\" he commanded, \"it's reserved for members of the bar, but it's all right.", "You're with ME.\" Distinctly annoyed, slightly bewildered, the banker sank between the arms of a chair.", "He felt he had lost his individuality.", "Andrews had become his sponsor.", "Because of Andrews he was tolerated.", "Because Andrews had a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among police-court lawyers.", "No longer was he Arnold Thorndike.", "He was merely the man \"with Mr. Andrews.\" Then even Andrews abandoned him.", "\"The judge'll be here in a minute, now,\" said the assistant district attorney, and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judge's bench.", "There he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of Mr. Andrews.", "Seated on the rail, with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr. Thorndike, they laughed and talked together.", "The subject of their discourse was one Mike Donlin, as he appeared in vaudeville.", "To Mr. Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely forgotten him.", "He arose, and touched his sleeve.", "With infinite sarcasm Mr. Thorndike began: \"My engagements are not pressing, but\u2014\" A court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail.", "\"Sit down!\" whispered Andrews.", "\"The judge is coming.\" Mr. Thorndike sat down.", "The court attendant droned loudly words Mr. Thorndike could not distinguish.", "There was a rustle of silk, and from a door behind him the judge stalked past."], "question": {"question": "Why did Thorndike touch Andrews' sleeve?", "sentences_used": [14, 17], "answers": [{"text": "To dust it off", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "To pull him closer", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "To get his attention", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "To tell him the judge was coming", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "0", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 0.25, 0.75, 0], "real_label": [0, 0, 1, 1], "single_answer": [0, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nHe arose, and touched his sleeve.\n\"The judge is coming.\" Mr. Thorndike sat down.\n\n[Options:]\nA: To dust it off\nB: To pull him closer\nC: To get his attention\nD: To tell him the judge was coming\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.
