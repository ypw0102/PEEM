The phrase \"it's reserved for members of the bar\" suggests that the chair is typically reserved for lawyers or other legal professionals. Mr. Andrews then adds that it's \"all right\" for the person to sit there, implying that he has permission to sit in the chair despite not being a member of the bar.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe passage does not mention anything about moving the chair, so option A is not relevant.\nThe passage does not mention the judge sitting in the chair, so option B is also not relevant.\nOption C is a possible interpretation of Mr. Andrews' command, but it's not explicitly stated in the passage.\nOption D is the most accurate interpretation of Mr. Andrews' command, as he wants the person to sit down in the chair he pointed to.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with Mr. Andrews' command is D.\nSo, The answer is:##[D]##\n\nPlease provide the actual question and passage, and I'll be happy to help you with the reading comprehension question!", " Sure!

However, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding Callisthenes' involvement.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that Alexander's royal pages were involved in the plot against his life, and Callisthenes of Olynthus was implicated in the plot, but the extent of his involvement is still a matter of debate among historians.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers that align with the information provided in the passage are:\n\nA: Alexander's royal pages (mentioned as instigating the plot)\nC: Alexander's official historian (mentioned as Callisthenes of Olynthus, who was implicated in the plot)\n\nThe other options, B (Callisthenes of Olynthus) and D (Alexander's official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus), are not the best choices because they do not accurately reflect the information provided in the passage.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[AC]##", " Sure!

Here's my reasoning process and answer for Sample4:\n\nThe passage clarifies a misconception about the role of the DCI (Director of Central Intelligence) in the US government. It states that many people wrongly assume that the DCI has line authority over the heads of various agencies and the power to shift resources within their budgets. The passage then clarifies that neither of these assumptions is true.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that option A (\"Yes, it does\") is incorrect, as the passage explicitly states that the DCI does not have line authority over the heads of agencies.

The protagonist also mentions that they hesitated for perhaps half a minute, indicating that they were considering something carefully before making a decision.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate options A, C, D, E, and F, as they are not directly related to the protagonist's hesitation or the cellar. Option A is a description of the cellar, but it does not explain the protagonist's hesitation. Option C is not supported by the passage, as there is no mention of the protagonist feeling sleepy. Option D is incorrect, as the protagonist mentions that they had been in the cellar before. Option E is also incorrect, as the passage does not suggest that the protagonist is scared of the cellar. Option F is not supported by the passage, as there is no mention of the protagonist having already been to the cellar that evening.\n\nThat leaves us with options B and G.

Therefore, options A, D, and F are not relevant to the context provided.\n\nOption C mentions that the names of the companies are confidential, which aligns with the information in the passage. However, it also mentions that the website is www.eeo1.com, which is not related to the confidentiality of the company names. Therefore, option C is not the best answer.\n\nOption E mentions that the study can be found at bls.org, which is not related to the information provided in the passage.\n\nOption B mentions that the website www.eeo1.com is unknown to the researchers, which is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nThe answer is:##[A]##\n\nThe reasoning process for this question involves carefully analyzing the information provided in the passage and identifying the relevant information related to the options given.

The police stated that the victim was in his 30s, which means he was somewhere between 30 and 39 years old, inclusive.\n\nOption C, \"Younger than thirty,\" is incorrect because the passage states that the victim was in his 30s, which means he was at least 30 years old.\n\nOption D, \"At least 50,\" is also incorrect because the passage does not mention the victim's age as being 50 or older.\n\nOption E, \"Between 30 and 40,\" is incorrect because it is not explicitly stated in the passage.

I'm happy to help you with that. Please provide the actual passages and options for the samples you want me to read and I'll be glad to assist you. ", " Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning process and answer for Sample4:\n\nThe passage provides information about al Qaeda's response to the deployment of U.S. troops to Somalia in 1992. Specifically, the passage states that al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding the eviction of U.S. troops. Additionally, the passage mentions that bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, but no Americans were killed.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that options A, C, and E are not the best answers. Option A, \"They formulated a fatwa,\" is mentioned in the passage, but it does not directly relate to the bombings or the targeting of U.S. troops. Option C, \"Two of their bombs exploded where U.S. troops routinely stopped,\" is also mentioned in the passage, but it does not accurately summarize the information provided. Option E, \"They formulated a network,\" is not mentioned in the passage at all.\n\nTherefore, the best answers are options B and D. Option B, \"Two hotels in Aden were bombed,\" accurately summarizes the information provided about the bombings in Aden. Option D, \"They send suicide bombers to their hotel,\" is also a reasonable inference based on the information provided, as it suggests that al Qaeda's fatwa demanding the eviction of U.S. troops may have led to suicide bombings targeting U.S. troops.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[BD]##", " Sure!

It implies that the individual is able to sit among police-court lawyers because he has a sponsor, which is consistent with the information in the passage.\nB: Because he was sponsored by Mr. Andrews - This option is similar to A, but it uses slightly different wording. It also implies that the individual's ability to sit among police-court lawyers is due to Andrews' sponsorship.\nC: He was with Mr. Andrews - This option does not fit the information in the passage. The passage does not mention the individual being with Andrews, but rather that Andrews is his sponsor.\nD: He was a banker - This option is not relevant to the information in the passage. The passage does not mention the individual's occupation or any connection to banking.\nE: Because he was in charge - This option is also not relevant to the information in the passage. The passage does not mention the individual being in charge of anything.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, the best answer is either A or B.

The passage does not mention the individual's occupation or any other relevant details that could help us determine the correct answer.\n\nBased on the information provided, options A, B, and E do not directly relate to the context of the passage. Option A mentions \"because of his sponsor,\" which could potentially be a correct statement, but it's not specific enough to be the sole correct answer. Option B is similar to A, and option E does not relate to the context at all.\n\nOption C mentions that the individual was with Mr. Andrews, which could be a possible reason for his tolerance and permission to sit among police-court lawyers. However, this option does not fully align with the given passage.\n\nOption D mentions that the individual was a banker, which has no relation to the context of the passage.\n\nTherefore, the best answer that aligns with the given passage is option B, \"Because he was sponsored by Mr. Andrews.\" This option directly correlates with the information provided in the passage, stating that Andrews had become his sponsor and that he was tolerated because of Andrews.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[B]##", " Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Options A, B, and C all mention Andrews and the individual's relationship with him, while options D and E do not.\n\nOption A, \"Because of his sponsor,\" could be a good fit, as it suggests that the individual's status is due to their sponsorship by Andrews.

Here's my reasoning process and answer for Sample 4:\n\nThe passage explains that Newton was the first to suggest that gravity is universal, meaning that it affects all objects in the universe. The passage also mentions that this is why Newton's law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine that the correct answer must relate to the concept of gravity being universal and affecting all objects in the universe.\n\nOption A, \"Because there is gravity all around you,\" is not a correct answer as it implies that gravity is only present in the immediate surroundings, whereas the passage states that gravity affects all objects in the universe.\n\nOption C, \"Because it is about exertion,\" is also not a correct answer as the passage does not mention anything about exertion.\n\nOption D, \"Because it deals with the motion of objects,\" is partially correct as Newton's law of gravity does indeed deal with the motion of objects, but this is not the main reason why it's called the law of universal gravitation.\n\nOption E, \"That means gravity affects all objects in the universe,\" is a correct answer as it directly relates to the universal nature of gravity that the passage mentions.\n\nOption B, \"Gravity is universal. That means gravity affects all objects in the universe,\" is also a correct answer as it directly states the main idea of the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers for Sample 4 are:\nThe answer is:##[BE]##", " Sure!

Here's my reasoning process and answer for Sample4:\n\nThe passage explains Newton's law of gravity, specifically that gravity is universal and affects all objects in the universe. The passage also mentions that this law is called the law of universal gravitation.\n\nOption A, \"Because there is gravity all around you,\" is not a correct explanation for the law of universal gravitation. While it is true that gravity is present all around us, this option does not accurately convey the idea that gravity affects all objects in the universe.\n\nOption B, \"Gravity is universal. That means gravity affects all objects in the universe,\" is a correct explanation for the law of universal gravitation. This option accurately summarizes the idea that gravity is a universal force that affects all objects, regardless of their location or size.\n\nOption C, \"Because it is about exertion,\" is not a correct explanation for the law of universal gravitation. The passage does not mention anything about exertion or effort.\n\nOption D, \"Because it deals with the motion of objects,\" is also not a correct explanation for the law of universal gravitation. While gravity does play a role in the motion of objects, this option does not accurately convey the idea that gravity affects all objects in the universe.\n\nOption E, \"That means gravity affects all objects in the universe,\" is a correct explanation for the law of universal gravitation.

Therefore, this option is relevant and aligns with the context.\n\nB: Baseball - This option corresponds to one of the boy's activities, which is mentioned in the passage. Therefore, this option is relevant and aligns with the context.\n\nC: Andrew - This option corresponds to the boy's friend, who is mentioned in the passage. Therefore, this option is relevant and aligns with the context.\n\nD: Sean - This option corresponds to the boy's imaginary friend, who is mentioned in the passage. Therefore, this option is relevant and aligns with the context.\n\nE: Basketball - This option corresponds to one of the boy's activities, which is mentioned in the passage.

This implies that basketball and baseball are two activities that the person engages in.\n\nThe second sentence reveals that the person plays with their friends Mandy and Andrew. This indicates that Mandy and Andrew are friends of the person, and they engage in activities together.\n\nThe third sentence introduces an imaginary friend named Sean. This means that Sean is not a real person but a fictional character created by the individual's imagination.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can deduce the following:\n\n* The person plays basketball and baseball, which corresponds to options E (Basketball) and B (Baseball).\n* Mandy and Andrew are friends of the person, which aligns with options A (Mandy) and C (Andrew).\n* Sean is an imaginary friend, which means option D (Sean) is not a valid choice since the passage does not mention anything about the person playing with Sean or Sean being a friend.\n\nGiven the details in the

Andrews had become his sponsor.\n\nFrom the first sentence, we can infer that Andrews is instructing someone to sit down. The second sentence reveals that Andrews has become the sponsor of the person being addressed. Based on this information, we can deduce that the person being addressed is the one who is required to sit down.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA: The judge is here - This option does not relate to the context of the passage. The passage does not mention a judge, and there is no indication that the person being addressed is a judge.\n\nB: Stand up - This option is the opposite of what Andrews instructs the person to do. The passage clearly states that Andrews whispered \"Sit down!\", which means the correct action is to sit, not stand.\n\nC: Sit down - This option aligns with the instruction given by Andrews in the passage.

The options are: A (2010), B (2007), C (2000), and D (2002).\n\nSince the passage does not explicitly mention the year in which Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award, we need to use inference and logic to determine the correct answer. Based on the information provided, we know that Bandura was born on December 4, 1925, and was awarded the Grawemeyer Award at the age of 82. Therefore, we can calculate the year in which Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award by subtracting 82 from the current year (2023).\n\nUsing this logic, we can determine that Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award in 2003 (2023 - 82 = 2003).

The passage does not mention the specific year in which Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award. However, it does mention that Bandura was awarded the award at the age of 82.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that the year in which Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award is 2007.

This is why the narrator heard nothing when their shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks failed to keep the air in. Option A directly addresses the reason for the lack of sound in space, citing the absence of a medium for sound waves to propagate.\n\nOption B (the air was sucked away from the shuttle) doesn't fully explain the reason for the silence; instead, it only describes the situation that led to the silence. Option C (the air has been sucked out of the shuttle, so sound cannot travel) is similar to B, as it only states a consequence of the malfunction rather than the primary cause.\n\nOption D (their communications system was down) is unrelated to the context, as the passage doesn't mention any issues with communication systems.

The Greeks saw this gesture as something only deities were entitled to, and thus believed Alexander was trying to deify himself by requiring it.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that option B (Adopted elements of Persian dress and customs) is correct, as the passage explicitly states that Alexander adopted certain Persian customs, including proskynesis. Option A (Prostration on the ground) is also correct, as it is one of the forms of proskynesis mentioned in the passage.\n\nOption C (Symbolic kissing of the hand) is incorrect, as it is mentioned in the passage as an alternative form of proskynesis, but it is not the only form.

deduce the following:\nOption A (\"It doesn't work as well\") is incorrect, as the passage states that gravity can act over large distances, implying that it does work, albeit weaker.\nOption B (\"Gets weaker the farther apart objects are\") aligns with the information in the passage and accurately describes the effect of distance on the force of gravity.\nOption C (\"Not very well\") is vague and doesn't specifically address the effect of distance on gravity, making it an incorrect choice.\nOption D (\"It does get weaker the farther apart\") is a restatement of the information in the passage and is therefore a correct option.\nOption E (\"Great\") doesn't relate to the content of the passage and is an incorrect choice.\nOption F (\"It still works on objects far away, just how it affects the nearby objects\") is incorrect, as the passage states that the force of gravity weakens with distance, not that it remains the same.\nOption G (\"Gravity applies to objects that are not touching are far away, but the force gets weaker the further the distance between the objects\") is a paraphrased version of the information in the passage and is a correct option.\nOption H (\"Nonexistent\") is an incorrect choice, as the passage confirms the existence of gravity and its effect on objects.\nOption I (\"Gets stronger as you get farther away\") is the opposite of what the passage states, making it an incorrect choice.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the effect of distance on gravity are B, D, and G.\nSo, The answer

The passage only provides information about the population growth up to 250 b.c. and does not mention anything about what happened after that.\n\nC: 250 B.C. - This option is correct. The passage mentions that the population had grown to 100,000 by 250 b.c., which means that 250 b.c. is the correct answer.\n\nD: 200 B.C. - This option is incorrect. The passage does not mention anything about the population growth in 200 b.c.\n\nE: By 250 b.c. - This option is incorrect. Although the phrase \"by 250 b.c.\" is mentioned in the passage, it is not a specific date or event that can be used to answer the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[C]##\n\nI hope this helps!

Instead, it seems to be a gesture that catches Mr. Thorndike's attention (option C).\nThe passage does not mention anything about the person's intention to tell Mr. Thorndike that the judge was coming (option D).\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the context is C.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##", " Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning process and answer for Sample 4:\n\nThe passage describes a situation where a person (Mr. Thorndike) is sitting down, and another person (the speaker) is standing up and touching their sleeve to get Mr. Thorndike's attention. The speaker then says, \"The judge is coming.\"\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the speaker is trying to alert Mr. Thorndike to the fact that the judge is approaching. The speaker's action of touching their sleeve is likely a gesture to get Mr. Thorndike's attention, rather than to dust off their sleeve (option A) or pull him closer (option B).\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C: To get his attention. This option aligns with the context of the passage and accurately describes the speaker's action of touching their sleeve.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[C]##", " Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning process and answer for Sample 4:\n\nSample 4:\n[Passages:]\nHe arose, and touched his sleeve.\n\"The judge is coming.\" Mr. Thorndike sat down.\n\n[Options:]\nA: To dust it off\nB: To pull him closer\nC: To get his attention\nD: To tell him the judge was coming\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passage to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage describes a situation where a person (He) arises and touches his sleeve, followed by Mr. Thorndike sitting down. The passage also mentions that the judge is coming.\nBased on this information, we can infer that the person touched his sleeve to get Mr. Thorndike's attention and inform him that the judge is coming.\n\nOptions A (To dust it off) and B (To pull him closer) are not relevant to the context and do not align with the described actions in the passage.\nOption C (To get his attention) aligns with the inference that the person touched his sleeve to get Mr. Thorndike's attention.\nOption D (To tell him the judge was coming) is also a correct option as it directly states the reason for the person's action of touching his sleeve.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers that align with the actions and inferences in the passage are C and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[CD]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1]], "human": [0, 0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Fiction-stories-masc-A_Wasted_Day-5.txt-0"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction/mctest-mc160.test.12-0.txt", "qid": "3", "passage": ["Susan wanted to have a birthday party.", "She called all of her friends.", "She has five friends.", "Her mom said that Susan can invite them all to the party.", "Her first friend could not go to the party because she was sick.", "Her second friend was going out of town.", "Her third friend was not so sure if her parents would let her.", "The fourth friend said maybe.", "The fifth friend could go to the party for sure.", "Susan was a little sad.", "On the day of the party, all five friends showed up.", "Each friend had a present for Susan.", "Susan was happy and sent each friend a thank you card the next week."], "question": {"question": "How many people did Susan call?", "sentences_used": [1, 2], "answers": [{"text": "5", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Five", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "6", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "All of her firends", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "3", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [1, 1, 0, 0.75], "real_label": [1, 1, 0, 0], "single_answer": [1, 1, 0, 1], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nShe called all of her friends.\nShe has five friends.\n\n[Options:]\nA: 5\nB: Five\nC: 6\nD: All of her firends\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through. Initially, the rate for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation was $25 an hour. However, as of last week, he has increased this rate to a minimum of $50 an hour.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe new rate is $50 an hour, which corresponds to option A.\nThe old rate was $25 an hour, which is mentioned in option D.\nOptions B ($400) and C ($150) are not mentioned anywhere in the passage and are therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the raised rates and the original rates are A and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##\n\n\nSample2:\n[Passages:]\nLucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird.\nShe draws a picture of her family.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Martha\nB: Lucy\n\n[Analyses:]\nAnalyzing the provided passages gives us key information about the central figure in the narrative:\n\nLucy is identified as an eight-year-old girl.\nIt's stated that Lucy lives with her parents and a pet bird.\nLucy engages in an activity where she draws a picture of her family.\nGiven this context, the task requires selecting appropriate answers from the options A (Martha) and B (Lucy).

The passage also gives an example of a car's speed.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate options A, C, E, and G, as they do not directly relate to the information provided in the passage.\n\nOption A, \"How long it takes to travel that far,\" is not mentioned in the passage, and while it may be related to speed, it is not one of the two things mentioned as being necessary to determine speed.\n\nOption C, \"Using a speedometer,\" is also not mentioned in the passage, and while speedometers are used to measure speed, they are not part of the formula for calculating speed.\n\nOption E, \"How far something travels,\" is not mentioned in the passage, and while distance is part of the formula for calculating speed, this option does not relate to the formula or the information provided.\n\nOption G, \"Multiplying miles by the time,\" is not mentioned in the passage, and while it may be a way to calculate speed, it is not the formula provided in the passage.\n\nThat leaves us with options B, D, and F.\n\nOption B, \"Speed = distance time,\" is the formula provided in the passage and is therefore a correct answer.\n\nOption D, \"Multiplying distance by time,\" is a correct calculation, but it is not the formula provided in the passage, so it is not a correct answer.\n\nOption F, \"Speed can be calculated using this formula: speed = distance time A familiar example is the speed of a car,\" is a restatement of the information provided in the passage and is therefore a correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers for Sample 4 are:\nThe answer is:##[BF]##", " Sure!

Specifically, it states that force can cause an object at rest to start moving, and forces can cause a moving object to stop.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe passage is discussing the idea that force is required to move an object, and the application of force is necessary to initiate movement or bring an object to a stop.\nOptions A (Strength) and D (A force) align with this concept, as they both refer to the idea of applying force to achieve a specific outcome.\nOption B (Nothing, it will stop on its own) is not relevant to the context, as the passage explicitly states that forces are required to cause an object to stop.\nOption C (Apply force on the ball) is also not relevant, as the passage does not mention anything about applying force to a specific object, such as a ball.\nOption E (Pressure) is not mentioned in the passage and is not directly related to the concept of force and its effects on objects.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers that align with the concept of force and its effects on objects are A and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "predicts": [[1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Science-textbook/science-g3-9.txt-1"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g4-138.txt", "qid": "4", "passage": ["Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy.", "It occurs between objects or substances that are touching.", "Thermal conductors are materials that are good conductors of heat.", "Thermal insulators are materials that are poor conductors of heat.", "Both conductors and insulators have important uses.", "Convection is the transfer of thermal energy.", "This occurs as particles move within a fluid.", "The fluid may be a liquid or a gas.", "The particles within the fluid transfer energy by moving from warmer to cooler areas.", "They move in loops.", "These loops are called convection currents.", "Radiation is the transfer of thermal energy by waves.", "These waves can travel through empty space.", "When the waves reach objects, the heat is transferred to the objects.", "Radiation is how the Sun warms the Earths surface."], "question": {"question": "Are thermal insulators and thermal conductors both good conductors of heat?", "sentences_used": [2, 3], "answers": [{"text": "Thermal insulators are not good conductors of heat", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Only isulators are good conductors of heat", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "No, only thermal conductors are", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Only electricity conductors are good conductors of heat", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "No", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Yes", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Thermal conductors are poor conductors of heat", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "4", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0], "real_label": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], "single_answer": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nThermal conductors are materials that are good conductors of heat.\nThermal insulators are materials that are poor conductors of heat.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Thermal insulators are not good conductors of heat\nB: Only isulators are good conductors of heat\nC: No, only thermal conductors are\nD: Only electricity conductors are good conductors of heat\nE: No\nF: Yes\nG: Thermal conductors are poor conductors of heat\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through. Initially, the rate for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation was $25 an hour. However, as of last week, he has increased this rate to a minimum of $50 an hour.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe new rate is $50 an hour, which corresponds to option A.\nThe old rate was $25 an hour, which is mentioned in option D.\nOptions B ($400) and C ($150) are not mentioned anywhere in the passage and are therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the raised rates and the original rates are A and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##\n\n\nSample2:\n[Passages:]\nLucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird.\nShe draws a picture of her family.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Martha\nB: Lucy\n\n[Analyses:]\nAnalyzing the provided passages gives us key information about the central figure in the narrative:\n\nLucy is identified as an eight-year-old girl.\nIt's stated that Lucy lives with her parents and a pet bird.\nLucy engages in an activity where she draws a picture of her family.\nGiven this context, the task requires selecting appropriate answers from the options A (Martha) and B (Lucy). Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage. The options are: A (The equator), B (Australia), C (North pole), and D (New York).\n\nThe passage explicitly mentions \"the equator\" as the location where the described climatic conditions apply. The other options, Australia, the North Pole, and New York, are not mentioned in the passage and have varying climates that do not match the specific condition of unchanging seasons and constant average daily temperatures described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[A]##\n\nSample4:[Passages:]\nThermal conductors are materials that are good conductors of heat.\nThermal insulators are materials that are poor conductors of heat.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Thermal insulators are not good conductors of heat\nB: Only isulators are good conductors of heat\nC: No, only thermal conductors are\nD: Only electricity conductors are good conductors of heat\nE: No\nF: Yes\nG: Thermal conductors are poor conductors of heat\n\n[Analyses:]\n"}, "response": [" Sure, I'd be happy to help!
