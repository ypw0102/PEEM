Therefore, these options are not supported by the passage.\n\nThe correct answers, based on the information in the passage, are Options B, D, and G. Therefore, The answer is:##[BDG]##", "To answer this question, we must carefully analyze the passage and relate it to the options provided.\n\nThe passage provides several pieces of information:\n\n1. Ferdinand and Isabella were dedicated Spaniards focused on expanding their rule.\n2. Their grandson, who became king in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, indicating he was not a native Spaniard.\n3. Charles I (later Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) struggled with the Spanish language, which suggests potential communication barriers with his Spanish subjects.\n4. He surrounded himself with Burgundian and Flemish nobles, which could imply a preference for his native culture and people.\n5. His royal duties often kept him away from the traditional royal residences in Spain.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine the following:\n\nOption B (\"Being unable to speak the language\") and Option G (\"He could barely express himself in Spanish\") both directly reference the passage's mention of Charles I's difficulty with Spanish, so they are correct.\n\nOption D (\"Charles I was born in Flanders and could barely express himself in Spanish, which led to a separation between himself and his people\") is also correct, as it encapsulates the issues of his birthplace and language barrier, which could have contributed to a disconnect with his subjects.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the passage:\n\nOption A (\"The death of his parents\") is not mentioned.\nOption C (\"He had no tenure\") is not mentioned or implied.\nOption E (\"The war in Flanders\") is not mentioned in the context of Charles I's challenges as a ruler in Spain.\nOption F (\"Needing to overthrow Ferdinand and Isabella\") is not relevant since Charles I was their grandson and successor, not a usurper.\nOption H (\"His increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently in the comuneros revolt\") is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, although it could be inferred as a potential outcome of his difficulties; however, without direct reference, it's speculative.\nOption I (\"Conquering the Burgundians\") is not mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are B, D, and G, which are directly supported by the passage.\n\nThe answer is:##[BDG]##", "The passage provides information about the transition of the Spanish crown from Ferdinand and Isabella to their grandson, who would become Charles I of Spain and later Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor. The passage highlights several key points:\n\n- Ferdinand and Isabella were dedicated Spaniards focused on expanding their realm.\n- Their grandson, Charles I, was born in Flanders and struggled with the Spanish language.\n- Charles I surrounded himself with Burgundian and Flemish nobles.\n- He inherited the title of Holy Roman Emperor shortly after arriving in Spain.\n- His imperial responsibilities kept him away from Spain's royal residences.\n\nBased on this information, we can analyze the options provided:\n\nA: The death of his parents is not mentioned as a reason for any separation between Charles I and his people.\nB: Being unable to speak the language is mentioned as a characteristic of Charles I, but the passage does not directly link it to a separation between himself and his people.\nC: There is no mention of tenure in the passage.\nD: Charles I was born in Flanders and could barely express himself in Spanish, which could imply a separation between himself and his people due to the language barrier and his foreign birth.\nE: The war in Flanders is not mentioned in the passage.\nF: There is no mention of needing to overthrow Ferdinand and Isabella.\nG: He could barely express himself in Spanish is a fact stated in the passage.\nH: The comuneros revolt is not mentioned in the passage, so we cannot infer it as a reason for separation.\nI: Conquering the Burgundians is not discussed in the passage.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answers that align with the information in the passage are options D (since the language barrier and foreign birth could lead to a separation between Charles I and his people) and G (as it is a fact stated in the passage).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[DG]##", "To answer this question, we must analyze the passage to understand the context and then match that context to the most relevant options provided.\n\nThe passage provides the following information:\n- Ferdinand and Isabella were dedicated to expanding the Spanish crown.\n- Their grandson became the king in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and had difficulty expressing himself in Spanish.\n- This grandson was the first of the Habsburgs and filled his entourage with people from Burgundy and Flanders.\n- Upon his arrival in Spain and subsequent inheritance of the title of Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, he was often busy and away from Spain's royal residences.\n\nFrom the passage, we can deduce that:\n- Charles I's birthplace was Flanders (option D).\n- Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish (option D and G).\n- There is no mention of the death of his parents (option A), war in Flanders (option E), the need to overthrow Ferdinand and Isabella (option F), conquering the Burgundians (option I), or any violent protests by dissatisfied subjects (option H).\n- The passage does not mention anything about Charles I having no tenure (option C), so we cannot infer that from the provided text.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the correct answers are that Charles I was born in Flanders and had difficulty expressing himself in Spanish, which could have led to a separation between himself and his people.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[DG]##", "To answer this question, we need to analyze the passage to understand the context and the details provided about Charles I:\n\n- Ferdinand and Isabella were dedicated Spaniards who sought to expand their kingdom.\n- By contrast, their grandson, Charles I, who became king in 1516, was not originally from Spain but from Flanders, and had difficulties with the Spanish language.\n- Charles I was the first of the Habsburgs and surrounded himself with nobles from Burgundy and Flanders.\n- He also became the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, which meant he had responsibilities that kept him away from Spain's royal residences.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options in relation to the passage:\n\nA: The death of his parents - The passage does not mention the death of Charles I's parents as a factor.\nB: Being unable to speak the language - The passage mentions that Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish.\nC: He had no tenure - The passage does not discuss his tenure.\nD: Charles I was born in Flanders and could barely express himself in Spanish, which led to a separation between himself and his people - This is implied in the passage as a contrast to his grandparents.\nE: The war in Flanders - The passage does not mention any war in Flanders.\nF: Needing to overthrow Ferdinand and Isabella - The passage does not suggest that Charles I needed to overthrow his grandparents.\nG: He could barely express himself in Spanish - This is stated in the passage.\nH: His increasingly dissatisfied subjects protested violently in the comuneros revolt - The passage does not mention a revolt or dissatisfied subjects.\nI: Conquering the Burgundians - The passage does not mention conquering the Burgundians.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answers are those that reflect Charles I's challenges due to his birthplace and language barrier, which are options B, D, and G.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[BDG]##"],

It suggests that Smith's rates are lower than the typical fees in those areas.\n\nThe third passage explains that Smith's foundation serves a specific demographic: those who have too much money to qualify for federally funded legal services but not enough to afford a lawyer. This supports the idea that he charges less than other lawyers in the area, which is mentioned in option E.\n\nOption B (\"Being bad with money\") and option C (\"Not enough clients\") are not supported by the passages. There is no information suggesting that Smith is bad with money or that he doesn't have enough clients. The issue is explicitly stated to be the lack of federal grants.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passages, the correct answers are those that align with the lack of grants and the comparative affordability of Smith's services.

The going rates for lawyers in the Ogden area range from $150 to $250 an hour, and up to $400 an hour in the Salt Lake area.\n3. Smith's foundation is described as serving a demographic that does not qualify for federally funded legal services but cannot afford standard legal fees.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n\nOption A (Hoped-for grants not coming through to his business) is directly mentioned as the reason for raising his rates.\nOption B (Being bad with money) is not indicated or implied anywhere in the passages.\nOption C (Not enough clients) is not mentioned as a reason for the rate increase.\nOption D (Lack of grants) is essentially a rephrasing of Option A, indicating that the absence of grants is the issue.\nOption E (He did not receive a much needed grant and he charges far less than other lawyers in the area) is a comprehensive statement that includes the reason for the rate increase (not receiving the grant) and a comparative statement about his charges relative to other lawyers in the area, which is supported by the information in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers that align with the information provided in the passages are Options A, D, and E. So, The answer is:##[ADE]##", "Analyzing the provided passages, we can identify the reasons for the rate increase and the context of the lawyer's market:\n\n- The hoped-for federal grants haven't come through, which has led to the need to raise rates.\n- The lawyer's market in the Ogden area has fees ranging from $150 to $250 an hour, and up to $400 an hour in the Salt Lake area.\n- Smith's foundation is described as helping those who don't qualify for federally funded legal services but can't afford regular lawyer fees.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can deduce the following:\n\nOption A (Hoped-for grants not coming through to his business) and Option D (Lack of grants) both correctly describe the situation where the anticipated federal grants did not materialize, necessitating a rate increase.\nOption E (He did not receive a much-needed grant and he charges far less than other lawyers in the area) is also correct, as it summarizes both the grant issue and the comparative affordability of Smith's services.\nOption B (Being bad with money) is not supported by any information in the passage, as there is no indication that financial mismanagement is a factor.\nOption C (Not enough clients) is also not mentioned or implied in the passage. The reason for raising rates is explicitly linked to the lack of grants, not the quantity of clients.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passages, the correct answers are those that relate directly to the grant issue and the context of Smith's legal services pricing.

The same gentleman did not understand Edgar's \"peculiar and erratic nature\" and became particularly displeased upon discovering Edgar's debts at college.\n3.

The options given are A (Officials), B (Hospital Father and the Master of the English and Classical School), C (Mrs. Allan), and D (Mr. Allan, master of the English).\n\nOption C (Mrs. Allan) can be eliminated because the passage refers to the individual as a \"gentleman,\" which implies a male figure. Option A (Officials) is too vague and does not match the personal involvement indicated in the passage. Option B (Hospital Father and the Master of the English and Classical School) seems unrelated because the context does not suggest a religious or educational institution's involvement, but rather a personal relationship between Edgar and the gentleman.\n\nOption D (Mr. Allan, master of the English) appears to be the most plausible choice since it specifies a male figure and includes \"master of the English,\" which could imply a level of education or authority that would be concerned with Edgar's development and behavior.\n\nBased on the analysis of the passage and the elimination of other options, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is:##[D]##", "To address this reading comprehension question, we must scrutinize the passage to identify the correct answer(s) from the provided options.\n\nThe passage discusses a disagreement concerning a young man named Edgar:\n- The \"gentleman\" in the passage advised against something unspecified because it might make Edgar conceited, a trait he already exhibited.\n- It is clear that the gentleman did not understand Edgar's \"peculiar and erratic nature.\"\n- The gentleman was displeased to discover that Edgar had accrued debt at college.\n- There was an \"angry scene\" between Edgar and the gentleman, after which Edgar was instructed to leave the university and work in the \"counting-room.\"\n\nFrom the context, we can infer that the \"gentleman\" is an authority figure in Edgar's life who has the power to make decisions about his education and work. The passage does not explicitly mention who this gentleman is, but we can rule out some options:\n- Option A (Officials) is too vague and does not specify an individual.\n- Option B (Hospital Father and the Master of the English and Classical School) does not fit the context as it mentions more than one person and does not align with the singular \"gentleman\" described.\n- Option C (Mrs. Allan) is unlikely as the passage seems to suggest a male figure (referred to as \"he\").\n- Option D (Mr. Allan, master of the English) could be a plausible answer as it refers to a specific individual with a title that suggests authority and the ability to influence Edgar's circumstances.\n\nBased on the passage, the most reasonable conclusion is that the \"gentleman\" is Mr. Allan, who is likely an authority figure with a significant role in Edgar's life, such as a guardian or adoptive parent.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "The passage discusses a disagreement between two individuals regarding a boy named Edgar.

The options are:\n\nA: Officials\nB: Hospital Father and the Master of the English and Classical School\nC: Mrs. Allan\nD: Mr. Allan, master of the English\n\nThe passage does not mention \"Officials\" or \"Hospital Father and the Master of the English and Classical School\" as being involved in the situation. \"Mrs. Allan\" is also not mentioned in the passage. However, \"Mr. Allan\" is a plausible candidate because the passage refers to a singular male individual who has authority over Edgar and is involved in an educational context, which could be inferred from the mention of \"master of the English.\"\n\nMoreover, the passage indicates a personal and authoritative relationship between the gentleman and Edgar, as he has the power to decide Edgar's future regarding the university and his move into the counting-room. This suggests a paternal or guardian role, which would align with Mr. Allan if he were a father figure or guardian to Edgar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the information provided in the passage is Mr. Allan, which corresponds to option D.\n\nThe answer is:##[D]##", "The provided passage describes a situation involving a male figure (referred to as \"this gentleman\") and a boy named Edgar.

The options are:\n\nA: Officials\nB: Hospital Father and the Master of the English and Classical School\nC: Mrs. Allan\nD: Mr. Allan, master of the English\n\nOption C (Mrs. Allan) can be ruled out because the pronoun \"he\" is used, indicating the gentleman is male. Option A (Officials) is too general and does not fit the personal nature of the interaction described. Option B (Hospital Father and the Master of the English and Classical School) could be a potential answer if we had information linking Edgar to a school setting and if the \"Hospital Father\" or \"Master\" had a personal relationship with Edgar. However, the passage does not provide evidence of this.\n\nOption D (Mr. Allan, master of the English) seems to be the most likely answer because it specifies a single male figure who could have the authority to tell Edgar to leave the university and who might be concerned about Edgar's character and debts. The use of \"master of the English\" could imply a level of educational oversight or authority.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer to who \"this gentleman\" refers to is Mr. Allan.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "To determine the correct answer(s) from the provided options, we must analyze the passage for clues about the characters involved in the narrative:\n\nThe passage refers to \"this gentleman\" who advised against something unspecified in the excerpt, with the reason being that it would make Edgar conceited.\nIt is mentioned that the gentleman did not understand Edgar's peculiar and erratic nature and was displeased with Edgar's debts at college.\nThere was an angry scene between Edgar and the gentleman, after which Edgar was told to leave the university and work in the counting-room.\nThe passage does not provide explicit names but gives us a relationship and context to work with.

The term \"master\" can imply authority or guardianship, which aligns with the context of advising Edgar and being displeased with his actions.\nBased on the analysis, the most likely answer is Mr. Allan, master of the English, as this option fits the context of the passage and the gender of the character involved.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]], "human": [0, 0, 0, 1]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg_withoutQuotes/gutenberg-11249-0.txt-3"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction-stories-masc-A_Wasted_Day-5.txt", "qid": "4", "passage": ["Mr. Andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs.", "\"You sit there,\" he commanded, \"it's reserved for members of the bar, but it's all right.", "You're with ME.\" Distinctly annoyed, slightly bewildered, the banker sank between the arms of a chair.", "He felt he had lost his individuality.", "Andrews had become his sponsor.", "Because of Andrews he was tolerated.", "Because Andrews had a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among police-court lawyers.", "No longer was he Arnold Thorndike.", "He was merely the man \"with Mr. Andrews.\" Then even Andrews abandoned him.", "\"The judge'll be here in a minute, now,\" said the assistant district attorney, and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judge's bench.", "There he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of Mr. Andrews.", "Seated on the rail, with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr. Thorndike, they laughed and talked together.", "The subject of their discourse was one Mike Donlin, as he appeared in vaudeville.", "To Mr. Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely forgotten him.", "He arose, and touched his sleeve.", "With infinite sarcasm Mr. Thorndike began: \"My engagements are not pressing, but\u2014\" A court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail.", "\"Sit down!\" whispered Andrews.", "\"The judge is coming.\" Mr. Thorndike sat down.", "The court attendant droned loudly words Mr. Thorndike could not distinguish.", "There was a rustle of silk, and from a door behind him the judge stalked past."], "question": {"question": "What did the man who abandoned his point to in the beginning?", "sentences_used": [0, 8], "answers": [{"text": "Railed enclosure", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "A table", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "One of the oak chairs", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "4", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0.5, 0.25, 0.25], "real_label": [0, 0, 1], "single_answer": [1, 0, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nMr. Andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs.\nHe was merely the man \"with Mr. Andrews.\" Then even Andrews abandoned him.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Railed enclosure\nB: A table\nC: One of the oak chairs\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

There is no mention of Guy marrying his wife, meeting the Senator, marrying Miriam, or meeting Anne. While the passage does mention a meeting with Bruno, it is not presented as the start of Guy's problems, but rather the consequence of the initial problem with the alibi.\n\nGiven the details in the passages, the correct answers that align with the problems Guy is facing are A (the alibi not remembering the meeting) and G (Bruno's repeated appearances).\n\nSo, The answer is:##[AG]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passages to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passages describe a series of events involving two characters, Guy and Bruno:\n- Guy's problems begin when his alibi, an inebriated college professor who was on the same train, cannot remember their meeting. This information relates directly to option A (\"He can't remember his meeting\").\n- Guy's problems increase when Bruno begins to intrude into Guy's life, reminding him of an obligation to kill Bruno's father based on a supposed bargain they made on the train. This is related to option G (\"Bruno makes repeated appearances\").\n- The passage does not mention anything about marriage or a wife, so options B (\"He married his wife\") and E (\"Marrying Miriam\") are not relevant.\n- There is no mention of a senator or Anne, so options D (\"Meeting the Senator\") and F (\"Meeting Anne\") are also not relevant.\n- The passage does reference a meeting with Bruno, which is option C (\"Meeting Bruno\"), but it is not the cause of Guy's problems; rather, it is the content of their meeting and the aftermath that are problematic.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answers that align with the events described in the passages are A (the professor cannot remember the meeting) and G (Bruno makes repeated appearances to remind Guy of the supposed bargain).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AG]##", "To answer this question, we must carefully analyze the passages provided to determine which options are supported by the text.\n\nThe passages describe a sequence of events involving two characters, Guy and Bruno:\n\n- Guy's problems begin when his alibi, an inebriated college professor who was on the same train as Guy, cannot remember their meeting. This directly corresponds to option A, which states, \"He can't remember his meeting.\"\n- Guy's problems increase when Bruno, another character, intrudes into Guy's life. Bruno is reminding Guy of an obligation to kill Bruno's father, based on what Bruno believes was a bargain they made on the train. This is reflected in option G, \"Bruno makes repeated appearances.\"\n\nThe other options provided do not have any direct references in the passages:\n\n- Options B (He married his wife), D (Meeting the Senator), and E (Marrying Miriam) are not mentioned in the passages.\n- Option C (Meeting Bruno) could be inferred as part of the narrative since Bruno and Guy had some sort of interaction, but the passages do not explicitly mention a meeting with Bruno as the beginning of Guy's problems; rather, they focus on the college professor's inability to remember the meeting as the starting point of Guy's troubles.\n- Option F (Meeting Anne) is also not mentioned in the passages.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answers that align with the information in the passages are A and G. Therefore, The answer is:##[AG]##", "The passage describes a series of events that lead to Guy's problems:\n\nGuy has an alibi, which is an inebriated college professor who was on the same train as Guy. However, this alibi is unreliable because the professor cannot remember their meeting, which is directly related to option A.\nGuy's problems are compounded when Bruno, another character, begins to intrude into Guy's life. Bruno's intrusion is because he wants to remind Guy of an alleged bargain that Bruno believes they made on the train, which is related to option G.\nThe passage does not mention anything about Guy marrying his wife (option B), marrying Miriam (option E), or meeting Anne (option F). There is also no mention of meeting a Senator (option D).\nThe passage does refer to a meeting on the train, but it is in the context of Guy's alibi, the college professor, not remembering it. This could be linked to option C, \"Meeting Bruno,\" since Bruno is mentioned in relation to the train and the bargain he believes was made there. However, it's important to note that the passage does not explicitly state that the meeting Guy's alibi cannot remember is the same as the meeting with Bruno.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the correct answers that align with the events described are A (the professor cannot remember the meeting) and G (Bruno makes repeated appearances). There is some ambiguity about option C (Meeting Bruno), but it can be inferred that this is related to the bargain Bruno believes they struck on the train.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[ACG]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], "predicts": [[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]], "human": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}, "key": "wikiMovieSummaries-261107.txt-7"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g3-28.txt", "qid": "1", "passage": ["Gravity is a force, but not like other forces you may know.", "Gravity is a bit special.", "You know that a force is a push or pull.", "If you push a ball, it starts to roll.", "If you lift a book, it moves upward.", "Now, imagine you drop a ball.", "It falls to the ground.", "Can you see the force pulling it down?", "That is what makes gravity really cool.", "It is invisible.", "Invisible means you cannot see it.", "But wait, it has even more surprises.", "Gravity holds planets in place around the Sun.", "Gravity keeps the Moon from flying off into space.", "Gravity exerts a force on objects that are not even touching.", "In fact, gravity can act over very large distances.", "However, the force does get weaker the farther apart the objects are."], "question": {"question": "What is gravity in charge of?", "sentences_used": [12, 13], "answers": [{"text": "Keeping our planets around the sun", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Pulling two deperate objects towards eachother", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "A ball fly off the ground", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Keeping the Moon from flying off into space", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Pushing planets away from the sun", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Keeping the sun from burning out", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Gravity holds planets in place around the Sun and keeps the Moon from flying off", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Pulling objects", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Black holes", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "1", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [1, 0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.25, 1, 0.5, 0.25], "real_label": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "single_answer": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nGravity holds planets in place around the Sun.\nGravity keeps the Moon from flying off into space.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Keeping our planets around the sun\nB: Pulling two deperate objects towards eachother\nC: A ball fly off the ground\nD: Keeping the Moon from flying off into space\nE: Pushing planets away from the sun\nF: Keeping the sun from burning out\nG: Gravity holds planets in place around the Sun and keeps the Moon from flying off\nH: Pulling objects\nI: Black holes\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

However, since LSC is created by Congress, there is an indirect government connection, but it is not listed as a direct funding source in the passage.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answers are those that directly correspond to the named funding sources for LSSM.

However, since option A is more comprehensive, it is the preferred choice.\nOptions B (The president), C (Taxpayers), E (Fred Hall), F (The federal guidelines), and G (The government) are not mentioned in the passage as funding sources for LSSM. While LSC was created by Congress, which is a government entity, the passage does not explicitly state that the government directly funds LSSM.

These cuts were significant enough that the state legal-aid agencies, which relied on this funding, were threatened with extinction. To recover from these cuts, the passage mentions that LSEO (presumably one of these legal-aid agencies) was able to \"claw its way back\" with the aid of several sources: state funding, grant money, and the Tulsa Area United Way.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n- The cuts were made by Congress to the Legal Services Corp. (Options A, B, C, G, and H mention Congress and the Legal Services Corp.).\n- The agency recovered with the help of state funding, grant money, and the Tulsa Area United Way (Option A mentions all three of these sources).\n- The passage does not mention service drives (Option B), fundraisers (Option C), letter-writing campaigns (Option F), large donations from nonprofits (Option H), or a Tulsa attorney (Option I) as methods of recovery.\n\nOption D is a direct quote from the passage and accurately reflects the content. Therefore, it is also correct.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the sources of aid for LSEO are A and D.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##", "The passage discusses the financial challenges faced by state legal-aid agencies due to actions taken by Congress:\n\n- It mentions \"enormous cuts, beginning in 1996, by Congress to Legal Services Corp.,\" which identifies Congress's actions as the cause of the financial difficulty for state legal-aid agencies.\n- The passage then explains how LSEO (presumably a state legal-aid agency) managed to survive these cuts: \"Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we can evaluate the options:\n\nA: This option correctly combines the cause of the financial difficulty (cuts by Congress to Legal Services Corp.) with the means of recovery (state funding, grant money, and the Tulsa Area United Way).\nB, C, E, F, H: These options mention service drives, fundraisers, fundraising, letter-writing campaigns, and large donations from nonprofits, none of which are mentioned in the passage as methods LSEO used to recover.\nD: This option is a verbatim repetition of the entire passage, which is not an answer to a specific question but rather a restatement of the given information.\nG: This option only mentions \"Congress to Legal Services Corp.,\" which is part of the problem but doesn't include the recovery methods.\nI: \"A Tulsa attorney\" is not mentioned in the passage in any context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that accurately reflects both the problem (cuts by Congress) and the solution (state funding, grant money, and the Tulsa Area United Way), which is option A.\n\nThe answer is:##[A]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we must analyze the provided passage to determine which of the given options are supported by the text.\n\nThe passage discusses the financial challenges faced by a legal aid organization:\n- It mentions \"enormous cuts\" made by Congress to the Legal Services Corp. starting in 1996, which was the chief funding source for state legal-aid agencies.\n- The passage then explains that the Legal Services Eastern Oklahoma (LSEO) was \"threatened with extinction\" but managed to \"claw its way back\" with the assistance of \"state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we can identify the correct answers as follows:\n- Option D is a direct restatement of the passage, summarizing the cuts made by Congress and the subsequent recovery of LSEO with the help of various funding sources.\n- Option A lists the sources that helped LSEO recover, which are mentioned in the passage: \"state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way.\"\n- Options B, C, E, F, G, H, and I are not supported by the passage. There is no mention of service drives, fundraisers, letter-writing campaigns, large donations from nonprofits, or a Tulsa attorney in the context of funding recovery for LSEO.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and D, which are supported by the information provided in the passage.\n\nThe answer is:##[AD]##", "The passage discusses the financial challenges faced by state legal-aid agencies due to cuts made by Congress to their chief funding source, the Legal Services Corp. It specifically mentions that these cuts began in 1996 and were substantial. The agency referred to as LSEO managed to survive despite the threat of extinction by securing state funding, grant money, and support from the Tulsa Area United Way.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n- The phrase \"enormous cuts, beginning in 1996, by Congress to Legal Services Corp., the chief funding source for state legal-aid agencies\" directly matches with option D.\n- The statement \"Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way\" corresponds to the latter part of option D and also matches with the elements listed in option A.\n- Options B, C, E, F, H, and I are not mentioned in the passage as methods or sources of aid for LSEO. Therefore, they are not relevant to the context provided.\n- Option G is incomplete and lacks the additional information about how LSEO survived, which is provided in option A and D.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the information about the cuts and the recovery of LSEO are A and D.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AD]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passage and cross-reference the details with the options given.\n\nThe passage states:\n- There were enormous cuts to Legal Services Corp. by Congress starting in 1996.\n- Legal Services Corp. is identified as the chief funding source for state legal-aid agencies.\n- LSEO (Legal Services of Eastern Oklahoma) faced the threat of extinction due to these cuts.\n- LSEO managed to recover with the assistance of state funding, grant money, and the Tulsa Area United Way.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can deduce the following:\n- Option A is correct as it lists all the sources of assistance that helped LSEO recover: state funding, grant money, and the Tulsa Area United Way.\n- Options B, C, E, F, H, and I are incorrect because they mention methods or entities (service drives, fundraisers, letter-writing campaigns, large donations from nonprofits, a Tulsa attorney) that are not indicated in the passage as means of recovery for LSEO.\n- Option D is a verbatim excerpt from the passage and is correct as it restates the facts provided.\n- Option G is partially correct as it mentions Congress and Legal Services Corp.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer that aligns with the information in the passage is that he failed.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[D]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passages to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passages provide the following information:\n\n- Alexander had an intention to cross to Asia.\n- Before doing so, he aimed to secure his northern borders.\n- While he was campaigning in the north, there was a rebellion by the Thebans and Athenians.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Alexander had a goal in mind (to cross to Asia), which implies he had not yet achieved it at the time of the events described in the passage.\n- The fact that there was a rebellion while he was campaigning suggests that his efforts to secure his northern borders were not entirely successful, as his attention was diverted by the need to deal with the rebellion.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that:\n\n- Option A (Hellfire) is not relevant to the context provided.\n- Option B (Goal accomplished) does not accurately reflect the situation, as the passage does not confirm that Alexander's goal was accomplished.\n- Option C (No) could be interpreted as a negation of the success in securing the northern borders or crossing to Asia.\n- Option D (He failed) could indicate that Alexander's efforts to secure his northern borders were not successful due to the rebellion.\n- Option E (Yes and yes) is not supported by the passage as it suggests affirmative answers to questions not clearly stated in the text.\n\nThe most logical conclusion based on the passages is that Alexander's goal of crossing to Asia and securing his northern borders was not fully accomplished due to the rebellion. Therefore, the correct answer is that he failed to safeguard his northern borders as he intended before crossing to Asia.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[D]##", "The provided passages give us information about Alexander's strategic military actions:\n\n- Alexander intended to secure his northern borders before moving on to Asia.\n- During his campaign in the north, there was a rebellion by the Thebans and Athenians.\n\nFrom the context, we can infer that Alexander's goal was to ensure that his northern borders were secure before he proceeded to Asia. The second sentence indicates that while he was campaigning in the north, a rebellion occurred, suggesting that his attention was diverted from his original plan due to this unrest.\n\nGiven the options provided:\nA (Hellfire) is irrelevant and not mentioned in the passages.\nB (Goal accomplished) suggests that Alexander's objective was achieved, but the passage does not confirm that his northern borders were indeed secured; it only states his intention.\nC (No) is a negative response but lacks context on its own.\nD (He failed) implies that Alexander did not achieve his objective. The rebellion during his campaign indicates a setback, which could be interpreted as a failure to secure his borders as he intended.\nE (Yes and yes) implies an affirmative to two conditions, but the passage only provides information on one condition (the rebellion), and there is no clear affirmation of success.\n\nBased on the passages, the most logical conclusion is that Alexander faced a challenge in the form of a rebellion, which implies a complication or failure in his efforts to secure the northern borders before moving on to Asia.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}, "key": "Wiki_articles/wikiAlexander the Great-18.txt-4"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g5-88.txt", "qid": "1", "passage": ["The Earth is tilted 23 1/2 on its axis.", "This means that as the Earth rotates, one hemisphere has longer days with shorter nights.", "At the same time the other hemisphere has shorter days and longer nights.", "For example, in the Northern hemisphere summer begins on June 21.", "On this date, the North Pole is pointed directly toward the Sun.", "This is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.", "The South Pole is pointed The hemisphere that is tilted away from the Sun is cooler because it receives fewer direct rays.", "As Earth orbits the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere goes from winter to spring, then summer and fall.", "The Southern Hemisphere does the opposite from summer to fall to winter to spring.", "When it is winter in the Northern hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa.", "What does this mean for you?", "If you live in North America, July 1 is usually a very warm day.", "If you traveled to Southern Australia, you would need a heavy coat.", "At the equator, the seasons never change.", "As a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.", "There is no summer and winter as we know them."], "question": {"question": "What happens on June 21 in the Northern Hemisphere?", "sentences_used": [4, 5], "answers": [{"text": "On this date, the North Pole is pointed directly toward the Sun; this is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "it is summer", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Summer begins.

He explained that he wanted a more suitable bride for Alexander than the daughter of a Carian (Pixodarus).\n- Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends and had Thessalus brought to him in chains.\n\nBased on the information given in the passage, we can deduce the following:\n- The reason Philip exiled Alexander's friends and punished Thessalus was not explicitly stated as being because they were traitors (option A), so this option is incorrect.\n- Option B describes the actions of Alexander's friends and Thessalus correctly, as they did convince Alexander to counter Pixodarus's offer and Thessalus was indeed the actor sent to Pixodarus.\n- Option C is a statement made by Philip explaining why he stopped the negotiations; he wanted a better bride for Alexander.\n- Option D is a fact mentioned in the passage; Philip indeed stopped the negotiations after learning of Alexander's actions.\n- Option E, \"To punish Alexander,\" is not directly stated in the passage. However, the actions of exiling Alexander's friends and bringing Thessalus in chains can be interpreted as indirect punishment for Alexander, so it could be considered correct.\n- Option F is incorrect because it was Arrhidaeus, not Alexander, to whom Pixodarus initially offered his daughter.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answers are B (the friends convinced Alexander and Thessalus was sent to Pixodarus), C (Philip wanted a better bride for Alexander), D (Philip stopped the negotiations), and E (the actions taken by Philip can be seen as a punishment for Alexander).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[BCDE]##", "To answer this question, we must analyze the passage to understand the actions taken by Philip and the reasons behind them:\n\n- Olympias and Alexander's friends suggested that Philip's intentions to have Arrhidaeus marry Pixodarus's daughter indicated that he wanted to make Arrhidaeus his heir.\n- Alexander responded by sending Thessalus to Pixodarus to propose that Pixodarus's daughter should marry Alexander instead of Arrhidaeus.\n- Upon learning of Alexander's interference, Philip halted the marriage negotiations and reprimanded Alexander for wanting to marry the daughter of a Carian, stating that he desired a more suitable bride for him.\n- Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends and had Thessalus brought to him in chains.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce the following:\n\nOption A (Because they were traitors) is not directly supported by the text.

He also explained to Alexander that he did not want him to marry the daughter of a Carian because he wanted a better bride for him.\nPhilip then exiled four of Alexander's friends and had Thessalus brought to him in chains.\n\nNow, let's match the options with the passage:\n\nOption A: Because they were traitors - The passage does not mention that the friends were traitors.\nOption B: Because they convinced Alexander that because Pixodarus offered his daughter to his half-brother, this meant that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir and Thessalus was the actor who went to Pixodarus to convince him to offer his daughter to Alexander instead - This option aligns with the passage. Alexander's friends suggested that Philip's actions indicated he intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir, and Thessalus was sent to Pixodarus.\nOption C: He wanted a better bride for Alexander - This is true according to the passage.

There is no mention of treason or betrayal.\nOption B is correct because it summarizes the events leading to Philip's reaction: friends convincing Alexander about the implication of the marriage offer, and Thessalus being sent to Pixodarus.\nOption C (\"He wanted a better bride for Alexander\") is correct as it is explicitly stated in the passage that Philip wanted a better bride for Alexander.\nOption D (\"He stopped the negotiations\") is correct since the passage mentions Philip stopped the negotiations after hearing about Alexander's actions.\nOption E (\"To punish Alexander\") could be inferred as a reason for Philip's actions, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. The passage does not directly state that the exile of Alexander's friends and the arrest of Thessalus were meant as punishment for Alexander, so this option is less clear-cut.\nOption F (\"Because Pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother\") is incorrect.

The options given are A (Amphetamines), B (Drugs), C (Humans), D (Guns), and E (Narcotics).\n\nBased on the passage, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word \"drugs\" is a general term that encompasses any substance that is used or intended to be used to modify or explore physiological systems or pathological states for the benefit of the recipient. This term would cover both legal and illegal substances, including narcotics.\n- \"Narcotics\" is a term often used to describe a class of substances that dull the senses and are typically used as analgesics or for their soothing effects; however, it is also commonly used in a legal context to refer to illegal drugs.\n- \"Amphetamines\" are a specific type of drug and are not mentioned in the passage.\n- \"Humans\" are mentioned in the context of being targets (rival drug dealers), but the focus of the criminal activity is the drug trade, not the humans themselves.\n- \"Guns\" are implied as the method of assassination (shooting), but the central issue in the complaint is the arrangement to kill rival drug dealers, which relates to the drug trade.\n\nGiven that the passage is about the arrangement to kill rival drug dealers, the correct answers are those related to the drug trade.

The passage mentions \"rival drug dealers,\" which implies that the context involves illegal drug activities. This directly relates to options B (Drugs) and E (Narcotics), as both terms are commonly associated with illegal substances that drug dealers would be involved with.\n\nThere is no specific mention of amphetamines (A), humans (C), or guns (D) in the context of the passage. Although guns are likely involved as the method of killing is shooting, the passage does not explicitly mention guns; it focuses on the plan to kill drug dealers.

The options provided are A (Amphetamines), B (Drugs), C (Humans), D (Guns), and E (Narcotics).\n\nAmphetamines and Narcotics are specific types of drugs, but the passage does not specify which drugs are involved, only that the targets were \"rival drug dealers.\" Therefore, the more general term \"Drugs\" (option B) is appropriate. The term \"Narcotics\" (option E) could also be considered correct since narcotics are a type of drug, and the term is often used in a legal context to refer to illegal drugs in general. However, without more specific information about the type of drugs, \"Drugs\" (option B) is the most directly supported by the passage.\n\nThe passage does not provide any information about humans being the subject of the transaction, so option C is not relevant. While guns may be implied as the weapons used by the assassins (since the method of assassination is shooting), the passage does not explicitly mention guns as the object of the arrangement, so option D is not the focus of the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers based on the information provided are related to the drug dealings mentioned.

Here is the analysis of each option:\n\nA: Amphetamines - This option specifies a type of drug, but the passage does not mention amphetamines specifically; it mentions drug dealers generally.\nB: Drugs - This is a general term that encompasses any kind of illegal substance, including what drug dealers might be associated with.\nC: Humans - While the passage does involve humans (assassins and drug dealers), the context is specifically about the criminal activity related to drugs, not humans as a general category.\nD: Guns - The passage implies the use of guns because it mentions that the killers would shoot their targets. However, guns are not the focus of the criminal activity described; they are a means to an end.\nE: Narcotics - This term is synonymous with drugs, especially in the context of illegal drug trade.\n\nBased on the passage, the most appropriate answer options that directly relate to the context of arranging the killing of rival drug dealers are related to drugs and narcotics.

The options are: A (Edgar Allan Poe), B (Edgar Poe Allan), C (Drug), and D (Poe Allan).\n\nThe name \"Edgar\" is given, and \"Poe\" is mentioned as the surname, which is consistent with the well-known name of the writer Edgar Allan Poe. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. The other options, B (Edgar Poe Allan) and D (Poe Allan), do not match the standard naming convention of Edgar Allan Poe. Option C (Drug) is unrelated to the information provided in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[A]##", "The passage provides specific details about a person named Poe and his relationship with someone named Mr. Allan:\n\nThe passage refers to a change in Poe's life at the age of eighteen.\nIt is mentioned that Mr. Allan did not have the same affection for him as Mrs. Allan did.\nMr. Allan was displeased upon discovering that Edgar had incurred debts at college.\nThe passage suggests that \"Edgar\" and \"Poe\" refer to the same person, as it discusses the debts incurred by Edgar and the displeasure of Mr. Allan in one context.\nThe passage does not mention any \"Edgar Allan Poe,\" \"Edgar Poe Allan,\" or \"Poe Allan\" explicitly. However, the name \"Edgar\" and the surname \"Poe\" suggest that the person being referred to could be Edgar Allan Poe, the famous writer, especially given the context of the debts and the displeasure of a guardian figure, which is part of Poe's known biography.\nThe option C (Drug) is irrelevant to the context provided in the passage and does not match any names or subjects mentioned.\nGiven these details, the most logical conclusion based on the passage is that the person referred to is Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[A]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage to extract the relevant information and determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passage provides the following information:\n\n- A person named Poe experienced a change in life at the age of eighteen.\n- Mr. Allan's feelings toward Poe are contrasted with those of Mrs. Allan; Mr. Allan did not have the same affection for Poe.\n- Mr. Allan was displeased to discover that Poe had accumulated debt at college.\n- The passage refers to the individual as \"the boy\" and \"Edgar,\" suggesting that Edgar is the boy's first name and Poe is his surname.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The full name of the boy is likely Edgar Poe, as \"Edgar\" is mentioned as his first name and \"Poe\" is mentioned in the context of his surname.\n- The passage does not mention \"Edgar Allan Poe\" or \"Edgar Poe Allan\" in full, but given the common knowledge that Edgar Allan Poe is a famous writer, and the context of the surname \"Allan\" being associated with Mr. Allan, it is reasonable to infer that \"Edgar Allan Poe\" is the correct full name.\n- The option \"Drug\" (C) is irrelevant to the context provided as there is no mention of drugs in the passage.\n- \"Poe Allan\" (D) is not a correct option because it does not match the typical naming convention where the first name comes before the surname, and the passage does not refer to the individual in this way.\n\nGiven the details in the passage and common knowledge about Edgar Allan Poe, the correct answer that aligns with the name of the boy in the passage is A (Edgar Allan Poe).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[A]##", "In this passage, we are given some context about a person named Poe and his relationship with Mr. and Mrs. Allan. The key points to consider are:\n\n- The passage speaks about a change in Poe's life at the age of eighteen.\n- It is implied that Poe is the last name, as the text refers to \"the boy's peculiar and erratic nature,\" which suggests that Edgar is the first name.\n- Mr. Allan is mentioned, indicating that Allan is not Poe's last name but the last name of another family that was involved in his life.\n- The passage mentions that Mr. Allan did not have the same affection for him as Mrs. Allan did, which suggests that Poe is not a part of the Allan family by name.\n- The passage also makes it clear that Edgar had run into debt at college, which is a separate fact but does not help in determining the correct name.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option that fits the context of the passage is A: Edgar Allan Poe. This is a well-known name, and the passage gives enough clues to deduce that \"Edgar\" is the first name and \"Poe\" is the last name. Options B (Edgar Poe Allan) and D (Poe Allan) are incorrect because they suggest Allan is part of Poe's last name, which the passage does not support. Option C (Drug) is not a name and is irrelevant to the context of the passage.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[A]##", "The passage provides certain details about a person named Poe and his relationship with Mr. and Mrs. Allan:\n\n- Poe experienced a change in his life at the age of eighteen.\n- Mr. Allan lacked the affection for him that Mrs. Allan had.\n- Mr. Allan was displeased with Poe's debts incurred at college.\n- The passage mentions that Edgar is the first name of the individual in question, as seen in \"Edgar had run into debt at college.\"\n\nGiven this information, we can deduce that the correct answer must be the full name of the person referred to as Poe in the passage. The passage mentions \"Edgar\" as the first name, so we can eliminate option B (Edgar Poe Allan) and option D (Poe Allan) because these do not follow the conventional naming pattern where the last name follows the first name.\n\nOption A (Edgar Allan Poe) is the correct full name, as it is the well-known name of the famous writer and matches the information given in the passage.

The options are:\n\nA: Money - This option is not mentioned in the passage as being related to Chris Rock's detour.\nB: A Detour after carpool ride - This option is directly supported by the passage, which states that Chris Rock took a detour after a carpool ride.\nC: His daughter's friend - There is no mention of his daughter's friend in the passage.\nD: His daughter - His daughter is not mentioned in the passage.\nE: A Detour - This option is supported by the passage, which mentions that Chris Rock took a detour.\nF: A carpool ride - This option is supported by the passage, which states that the detour was prompted by a carpool ride.\nG: To get women - This option is not mentioned or implied in the passage.\nH: Car pool Ride - This option is a variant spelling of \"carpool ride,\" which is mentioned in the passage. However, since option F already captures this, and the passage uses the one-word spelling \"carpool,\" option H is less accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided in the passage, are B, E, and F. However, since B is a more complete answer than E and F (as it includes the cause and effect relationship), we can consider it the primary correct answer. F is also correct but is encompassed by B. E is a partial answer and is also encompassed by B.\n\nThe answer is:##[B]##", "The passage provides specific information about Chris Rock and a particular experience he had:\n\n- Chris Rock is referred to as a hair expert.\n- He took a detour in his career or life path after a carpool ride.\n- The carpool ride gave him an idea that he couldn't shake, implying it was a significant and impactful idea.\n\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that are directly related to the information given in the passage. The options are:\n\nA: Money - This option is not mentioned in the passage in relation to Chris Rock's detour or idea.\nB: A Detour after carpool ride - This option is a correct description of what happened to Chris Rock according to the passage.\nC: His daughter's friend - This option is not mentioned in the passage.\nD: His daughter - This option is not mentioned in the passage.\nE: A Detour - This option is correct but less specific than option B, which includes the reason for the detour.\nF: A carpool ride - This option is correct as it was the carpool ride that led to the idea.\nG: To get women - This option is not mentioned in the passage.\nH: Car pool Ride - This option is essentially the same as option F but with different capitalization and spacing.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the correct answers that align with Chris Rock's experience are B (A Detour after carpool ride) and F (A carpool ride). Option H could also be considered correct as it refers to the same event, despite the difference in formatting. Option E (A Detour) is accurate but less specific than option B, which includes the context of the detour.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[BFH]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], "predicts": [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]], "human": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "key": "News/CNN/cnn-3aad69ac9173d0db3e5f477b85d4a2ae8b26d019.txt-13"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "wikiMovieSummaries-10376197.txt", "qid": "3", "passage": ["Eric , a young boy , is excited about his birthday after reading a book and believes that a train will come for him , despite his sister Jill's disbelief .", "A few hours later , the train station's control tower wakes up and in the roundhouse , Tillie , a young little blue switcher engine , along with her best bird friend , Chip , wakes up four other trains : Georgia , a kind all-purpose engine , Farnsworth , a stuck-up passenger engine , Jebediah , a worn-out old engine , and Pete , a gruff , burly freight engine .", "After the tower assigns Farnsworth and Pete their jobs , Tillie tries to help with the milk train assigned to Jebediah , but the tower insists that she is too small for the job .", "Georgia is assigned to pull the birthday train .", "A clown named Rollo leads the toys into the train , including Stretch , a basketball player ; Missy , a ballerina ; a Handy Pandy , a panda ; Perky , an elephant ; and Grumpella , a stuffed bird .", "During her journey , Georgia breaks down and is taken back to the roundhouse by Doc .", "Left behind , Rollo eventually takes Doc's advice of flagging down one of the other engines returning from their daily runs over the mountain .", "Farnsworth and Pete turn down their offers to pull the train .", "Meanwhile , Tillie asks the tower to rescue the stranded train , but he insists that Tillie will never do the job .", "Jebediah turns down his offer to pull the train because of his age , and returns to the roundhouse .", "Chip and Tillie sneak past the sleeping tower and pulls the birthday train up a mountain ."], "question": {"question": "Which engine, other than Tillie, is both able and unable to pull the birthday train?", "sentences_used": [3, 5], "answers": [{"text": "Tower", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Chip", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Farnsworth", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Pete", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Jebediah", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "3", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25], "real_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "single_answer": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nGeorgia is assigned to pull the birthday train .\nDuring her journey , Georgia breaks down and is taken back to the roundhouse by Doc .\n\n[Options:]\nA: Tower\nB: Chip\nC: Farnsworth\nD: Pete\nE: Jebediah\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

Options A and D are too vague and do not provide any specific information relevant to the passage.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage that implies historical climate changes, the most appropriate and relevant option is B, which directly connects the idea of fossils providing clues to ancient climates.\n\nThe answer is:##[B]##", "The passage discusses changes in climate over time, indicating that regions with certain climate conditions now were once quite different. It implies that there has been a significant shift in the climate of various places, where cold regions might have been warm in the past, and hot and dry regions might have been wet and cool.\n\nThe options provided seem to be related to whether or not the passage is suggesting that evidence exists for these climate changes.

Option D could also be considered correct in a general sense, but it lacks the specificity of Option B.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##", "The passage discusses the changes in climate that have occurred over time in various locations:\n\n- It states that some places currently known for being cold were previously warm.\n- It also mentions that some places that are now characterized as hot and dry were at one time wet and cool.\n\nThe options provided seem to imply a question about whether something can provide information about the past climates or conditions of these places. Although the passage does not explicitly mention fossils, the idea that there can be evidence of past climates is implied by the statement that there has been a change in climate from one condition to another.\n\nOption B (\"Yes, the Fossils can even provide clues to ancient climates\") directly relates to the idea that there can be evidence of past climates. Fossils are known to be one of the methods through which scientists can infer the climate of an area in the distant past. Even though fossils are not explicitly mentioned in the passage, the context of changing climates over time suggests that evidence like fossils could indeed provide clues to ancient climates.\n\nOption C (\"They can tell us about species that did not survive\") is also plausible because the mention of changes in climate could imply that some species may not have survived these changes, and evidence such as fossils could tell us about these species.\n\nOption D (\"Yes\") is too vague without additional context, but it could be seen as an affirmative answer to the implied question of whether evidence can tell us about past climates.\n\nOption A (\"No\") does not align with the context provided by the passage, as the passage suggests changes over time, implying that there could be evidence of such changes.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answers that align with the idea of evidence providing clues to past climates and species are options B and C.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[BC]##", "The passage discusses the changes in climate that have occurred over time in various locations:\n\n- It states that some places that are currently cold were previously warm.\n- It also mentions that some places that are now hot and dry were at one time wet and cool.\n\nGiven this context, the task requires selecting appropriate answers from the options provided. The options are:\n\nA: No\nB: Yes, the Fossils can even provide clues to ancient climates\nC: They can tell us about species that did not survive\nD: Yes\n\nThe passage does not contain a direct question that the options A, B, C, or D could be responding to. However, we can infer that the passage suggests a change in climates over time, which could lead to the possibility that fossils can provide clues to ancient climates. Option B extends this idea by asserting that fossils can indeed provide such clues, which is consistent with the logical inferences that can be drawn from the passage. Option D simply agrees with the statement without additional context.\n\nOption A, which is a flat denial, does not match the information in the passage. Option C, while possibly true, is not directly supported by the information in the passage, which focuses on climate rather than species survival.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the passage and the logical inferences that can be made, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[B]##", "The passage provides insight into the historical climatic changes that have occurred over time:\n\n- It indicates that certain places that are currently cold had warmer climates in the past.\n- Similarly, it suggests that areas now characterized by hot and dry conditions were once wet and cool.\n\nThe task is to select the appropriate answer(s) from the given options, which are: A (No), B (Yes, the Fossils can even provide clues to ancient climates), C (They can tell us about species that did not survive), and D (Yes).\n\nOption B (Yes, the Fossils can even provide clues to ancient climates) is directly relevant to the context of the passage, as it implies that fossils can serve as evidence of past climatic conditions, which correlates with the idea that climates have changed over time. Although the passage does not explicitly mention fossils, option B is a plausible extension of the information provided, as fossils are one method by which scientists infer ancient climates.\n\nOption C (They can tell us about species that did not survive) may also be related to the topic of ancient climates, as knowing which species did not survive can provide indirect information about past climates. However, the passage does not directly discuss species survival, so this option is less directly connected to the passage than option B.\n\nOption D (Yes) is a simple affirmation but lacks context and does not provide a specific connection to the passage.\n\nOption A (No) is incorrect because it contradicts the information given in the passage.\n\nBased on the information in the passage and the relevance of the options, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is:##[B]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 1, 1]}, "key": "Science-textbook/science-g3-39.txt-2"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "News/CNN/cnn-3b0ff8796ddf508d1f1ef4c66ba29835ab642e7f.txt", "qid": "13", "passage": ["Hurlburt Field, Florida (CNN) -- An Air Force CV-22 Osprey crashed Wednesday during a routine training mission north of Navarre, Florida, injuring five crew members aboard, a military official said.", "The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m.", "at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield.", "The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said.", "The extent of their injuries was not immediately known.", "The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said.", "The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said.", "The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter.", "The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs.", "Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew.", "In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.", "A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002.", "The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.", "They were first deployed by the Marines in Iraq in 2007 after 18 years and $20 billion in development."], "question": {"question": "When was the Osprey operations halted and restarted?", "sentences_used": [10, 11], "answers": [{"text": "Halted 2000 restarted 2000", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Halted 2002 restarted 2002", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Halted 2000 restarted 2002", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "2000", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "1998", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "1989 and 2002", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "2007 and 2008", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "13", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0.25, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "real_label": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "single_answer": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nIn late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.\nA redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Halted 2000 restarted 2000\nB: Halted 2002 restarted 2002\nC: Halted 2000 restarted 2002\nD: 2000\nE: 1998\nF: 1989 and 2002\nG: 2007 and 2008\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The passage only mentions arriving at a cave, without any indication that it is used as living quarters.\nGiven the direct mention of a cave in the passage, the correct answer is the one that aligns with this information.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg_withoutQuotes/gutenberg-106-0.txt-11"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "wikiMovieSummaries-2444093.txt", "qid": "10", "passage": ["In 2415 , after a virus in 2011 wiped out 99 % of the Earth's population , all of the survivors inhabit Bregna , a walled city-state , Which is ruled by a congress of scientists .", "Although Bregna is idyllic , people are routinely disappearing and everyone is suffering from bad dreams .", "on Flux is a member of the ` Monicans ' , an underground rebel organization who communicate through telepathy-enabling technology and are led by The Handler .", "After a mission to destroy a surveillance station , on comes home to find her sister Una has been killed for being mistaken for a Monican .", "When on is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader , Trevor Goodchild , she discovers that both she and the Monicans are being manipulated by council members in a secret coup .", "This discovery causes on to question the origins of everyone in Bregna ; and in particular , her own personal connection to Trevor .", "It turns out that everyone in Bregna is actually a clone , grown from recycled DNA .", "With the dead constantly being reborn into new individuals and still bearing partial memories of their previous lives , there has been an increase in the troubling dreams .", "Recycling and cloning became necessary since the original viral antidote made humans infertile .", "Trevor's ongoing experiments , as with all his clone ancestors , has been trying to reverse the infertility .", "on learns that she is a clone of the original Trevor's wife , Katherine and is the first Katherine clone in over 400 years .", "One of Trevor's experiments , Una , was successful as she became pregnant ."], "question": {"question": "Why are people suffering from bad dreams?", "sentences_used": [0, 1], "answers": [{"text": "Virus", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The virus gives them nightmares", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "They remember their creation", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "They dream about the virus", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Still bearing partial memories of their previous lives", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Government", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "10", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [0, 0, 0.25, 0, 1, 0], "real_label": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "single_answer": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nIn 2415 , after a virus in 2011 wiped out 99 % of the Earth's population , all of the survivors inhabit Bregna , a walled city-state , Which is ruled by a congress of scientists .\nAlthough Bregna is idyllic , people are routinely disappearing and everyone is suffering from bad dreams .\n\n[Options:]\nA: Virus\nB: The virus gives them nightmares\nC: They remember their creation\nD: They dream about the virus\nE: Still bearing partial memories of their previous lives\nF: Government\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The tower's action of assigning jobs to Farnsworth and Pete is not an insistence about Tillie's capabilities, so it does not count towards the total number of times the tower insists on something regarding Tillie.\n\nTherefore, the tower insists on something regarding Tillie's capabilities two times in the passage.\n\nLooking at the options provided, we have:\nA (Two times), C (Twice), and F (2) all represent the number two.\nB (Once), D (1) represent the number one.\nE (Three times), G (3) represent the number three.\n\nSince the correct number is two, we can select options that represent the number two.\n\nThe answer is:##[ACF]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "predicts": [[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}, "key": "wikiMovieSummaries-10376197.txt-5"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g5-88.txt", "qid": "5", "passage": ["The Earth is tilted 23 1/2 on its axis.", "This means that as the Earth rotates, one hemisphere has longer days with shorter nights.", "At the same time the other hemisphere has shorter days and longer nights.", "For example, in the Northern hemisphere summer begins on June 21.", "On this date, the North Pole is pointed directly toward the Sun.", "This is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.", "The South Pole is pointed The hemisphere that is tilted away from the Sun is cooler because it receives fewer direct rays.", "As Earth orbits the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere goes from winter to spring, then summer and fall.", "The Southern Hemisphere does the opposite from summer to fall to winter to spring.", "When it is winter in the Northern hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa.", "What does this mean for you?", "If you live in North America, July 1 is usually a very warm day.", "If you traveled to Southern Australia, you would need a heavy coat.", "At the equator, the seasons never change.", "As a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.", "There is no summer and winter as we know them."], "question": {"question": "Why would one hemisphere (either northern or southern) have longer days and shorter nights than its opposite hemisphere?", "sentences_used": [0, 1], "answers": [{"text": "Because the Earth is tilted on its axis as it rotates.", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The earth's tilt points it to a different part of the sun.", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because of the tilt of the earth, one hemisphere does not experience direct rays from the sun", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The earth is weird", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because of the gravitation.", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because season change is required for many animals to survive.", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "5", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [1, 0.5, 0.25, 0, 0.25, 0], "real_label": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "single_answer": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nThe Earth is tilted 23 1/2 on its axis.\nThis means that as the Earth rotates, one hemisphere has longer days with shorter nights.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Because the Earth is tilted on its axis as it rotates.\nB: The earth's tilt points it to a different part of the sun.\nC: Because of the tilt of the earth, one hemisphere does not experience direct rays from the sun\nD: The earth is weird\nE: Because of the gravitation.\nF: Because season change is required for many animals to survive.\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

While it is true that companies are presumed to discriminate if their numbers are far below the norm, the passage does not state that this presumption is tied to being two standard deviations away from the curve.\nOption C: Is incorrect because the passage specifies at least two standard deviations, not one.\nOption D: Is a correct rephrasing of the criteria for being an \"intentional discriminator.\"\nOption E: Is not mentioned in the passage; there is no reference to data being extrapolated from federal data.\nOption F: Is incorrect as the passage does not mention easy employment for women and minorities.\nBased on the analysis, the correct options that align with the passage's criteria for identifying a company as an \"intentional discriminator\" are A and D.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AD]##", "To answer this question correctly, let's break down the information provided in the passages:\n\n1.

Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm.\n3. The term \"hard core\" discriminators is used to describe about 22,000 employers.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option against the information from the passages:\n\nA: This option is directly supported by the first statement in the passages, where it defines an intentional discriminator based on employment being at least two standard deviations from the average.\nB: This option seems to combine elements from both the first and second statements. However, the second statement does not specifically mention \"two standard deviations away from the curve,\" it simply says \"far below the norm.\"\nC: This option is incorrect because the passages specify \"at least two standard deviations,\" not one.\nD: This option is a paraphrase of the first statement, which is correct.\nE: This option is not directly supported by the passages. There is no mention of the data being \"extrapolated from federal data.\"\nF: This option is incorrect because the passages discuss discrimination, not easy employment.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answers are those that accurately reflect the content of the passages, which are options A and D.\n\nThe answer is:##[AD]##", "The passage provides specific criteria for labeling a company as an intentional discriminator:\n\nA company is described as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities deviates by at least two standard deviations from the average.\nLegally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are significantly lower than the norm.\nThe passage also mentions that about 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators, but it does not provide details on how this determination was made.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options given:\n\nOption A: This matches the description in the passage for a company being an intentional discriminator.\nOption B: This option adds the phrase \"and 2 standard deviations away from the curve,\" which is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it does imply that being far below the norm is in the context of standard deviations. However, the wording is slightly different from the passage.\nOption C: This is incorrect because the passage specifies \"at least two standard deviations,\" not one.\nOption D: This option is a restatement of the criteria for being an intentional discriminator, which is correct.\nOption E: The passage does not mention anything about extrapolating from federal data, so this option is not supported by the text.\nOption F: The passage does not mention anything about easy employment for women and minorities; thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct options that align with the criteria for a company being labeled as an intentional discriminator are A and D.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AD]##", "In the passage provided, we have several key points to consider:\n\n1. A company is described as an \"intentional discriminator\" if its employment of women or minorities is \"at least two standard deviations from the average.\"\n2. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are \"far below the norm.\"\n3. About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options in the context of these key points:\n\nA: This option is directly supported by the passage. It states the criteria for a company to be considered an intentional discriminator, which is if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average.\nB: This option is partially correct. It mentions employment numbers being far below the norm, which aligns with the passage. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the numbers need to be 2 standard deviations away from the curve; it only mentions two standard deviations from the average in the context of intentional discrimination.\nC: This option is incorrect because the passage specifies \"at least two standard deviations from the average,\" not one.\nD: This option is a rephrasing of option A, with the word \"discrimination\" misspelled as \"descrimination.\" However, it still conveys the same criterion described in the passage, so it is considered correct despite the typo.\nE: This option is not supported by the passage. There is no mention of federal data being extrapolated.\nF: This option is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that there is easy employment for women and minorities; rather, it discusses discrimination against these groups.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answers that align with the criteria for a company to be considered an intentional discriminator and the legal presumption of discrimination are options A and D.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AD]##", "The passage provides information about how a company is identified as an intentional discriminator:\n\n- A company is considered an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities is at least two standard deviations from the average.\n- Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm.\n- About 22,000 employers were identified as \"hard core\" discriminators.\n\nWith this information, we can analyze the options provided:\n\nA: This option is directly supported by the text, as it states the criteria for a company to be considered an intentional discriminator.\nB: This option adds an extra condition that is not mentioned in the passage (\"far below the norm and 2 standard deviations away from the curve\"). The passage only mentions the two standard deviations as the criteria.\nC: This option is incorrect because the passage specifies \"at least two standard deviations from the average,\" not one.\nD: This option is a rephrasing of option A and is also correct based on the passage.\nE: This option is not directly supported by the text.

This is not directly supported by the passage, as there is no mention of finding a space suit or reflecting on survival chances.\nOption B suggests that the individual found a space suit and saved their life. Again, the passage does not mention the individual finding a space suit.\nOption C implies being sucked away from the shuttle through a hole in the hull. This is not stated or implied in the passage; it only mentions a malfunction with the airlocks.\nOption D suggests that the individual managed to save Jesse's life. The passage does not mention anyone named Jesse or any life-saving actions.\nOption E states that \"Their eyes bulged in panic and they couldn't hear,\" which is a slight misinterpretation of the passage. The passage uses \"Eyes bulging in panic,\" but it refers to the narrator's eyes, not multiple people, and it confirms the absence of sound with \"I heard nothing.\"\nBased on the analysis, none of the options directly match the information given in the passage. However, Option E is the closest in context, even though it incorrectly suggests that multiple people were involved (\"their\" instead of \"my\"). The passage does describe a situation of panic and silence, which partially aligns with Option E, but due to the misinterpretation of the number of people involved, it is not a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, given the available options and their lack of perfect alignment with the passage, the most accurate answer based on the provided information is: The answer is:##[E]##", "To determine the correct answer(s), we need to carefully analyze the given passage and match it with the options provided:\n\nThe passage describes a situation where the shuttle malfunctioned, specifically with the airlocks not keeping the air in.\nIt mentions that there was no sound (\"I heard nothing\") and describes a person's reaction (\"Eyes bulging in panic\").\nThere is no mention of a space suit, saving anyone's life, or being sucked away from the shuttle.\nThe passage also does not specify that there was more than one person involved, so we cannot assume that \"they\" (plural) is accurate.\nBased on this analysis, we can rule out options A, B, C, and D, as they either add information not present in the passage or describe events not mentioned (like finding a space suit, being sucked away, or saving someone named Jesse).\n\nThe correct answer must be closely related to the details provided in the passage. The only option that accurately reflects the situation described is E (\"Their eyes bulged in panic and they couldn't hear\"), which captures the sense of panic and the absence of sound. However, the passage uses \"I\" and \"my,\" indicating a single person's perspective, not \"their,\" which suggests multiple people. Therefore, while option E is close, it is not entirely accurate due to the plural pronoun.\n\nGiven the passage and the options provided, none of the options perfectly match the information given. However, if we must choose the closest match, we would have to slightly modify option E to reflect the singular perspective (\"My eyes bulged in panic, and I couldn't hear\").\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[E]## (with the understanding that it is not a perfect match due to the pronoun issue).", "The passage describes a scenario involving a shuttle malfunction where the airlocks failed to contain the air, resulting in silence due to the vacuum of space (\"I heard nothing\"). The individual experiences panic, as indicated by the phrase \"Eyes bulging in panic,\" but there is no sound (\"but no screams\").\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA: The passage does not mention anything about the individual reflecting on their chances of survival after 24 hours or saving their life with a space suit.\nB: There is no mention of the individual finding a space suit or saving their life so far.\nC: The passage does not explicitly state that the individual was sucked away from the shuttle through a hole in the hull.\nD: There is no mention of a character named Jesse or anyone's life being saved.\nE: The passage does mention eyes bulging in panic, which aligns with the description in option E. However, it only refers to the narrator's eyes (\"Eyes bulging in panic\"), not multiple people (\"Their eyes\"), and the inability to hear is consistent with the passage (\"I heard nothing\").\n\nBased on the passage, the only option that is partially consistent with the provided information is option E, but it incorrectly pluralizes the subject (\"Their eyes\" instead of \"Eyes\" or \"My eyes\"). Despite this, it is the closest to the text as it does capture the essence of the panic and lack of sound.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[E]##", "The passage describes a situation where a shuttle has malfunctioned, specifically mentioning that the airlocks failed to contain the air. The narrative continues to describe the individual's reaction, with \"Eyes bulging in panic,\" but it's noted that there were no screams, implying that the situation occurred in a vacuum where sound cannot travel, such as space.\n\nBased on the passage, let's analyze the options:\n\nA: The passage does not provide any information about the individual saving his life with a space suit or reflecting on survival chances after 24 hours.\nB: There is no mention of finding a space suit to save the individual's life.\nC: The passage does not explicitly state that the individual was sucked away from the shuttle.\nD: There is no mention of a person named Jesse or the individual managing to save someone else's life.\nE: The passage describes a singular individual with \"Eyes bulging in panic,\" and the context suggests that they are in a vacuum (likely space) where they cannot hear. This option is consistent with the text.\n\nThe only option that aligns with the information given in the passage is E, as it reflects the individual's reaction to the malfunctioning airlocks and the absence of sound.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[E]##", "The passage describes a scenario involving a shuttle malfunction where the airlocks failed to contain the air, leading to a situation where the narrator experienced panic, evidenced by \"Eyes bulging in panic,\" but there were no audible screams, indicated by \"I heard nothing.\"\n\nTo determine the appropriate answer(s), let's analyze the options:\n\nA: This option suggests that the person saved their life with a space suit and contemplated survival chances after 24 hours. There is no mention of a space suit or survival chances in the passage.\nB: Similar to option A, this option mentions finding a space suit and saving one's life, which is not stated in the passage.\nC: This option describes being sucked away from the shuttle, which is not indicated in the passage. The passage only mentions a malfunction and the absence of sound.\nD: There is no mention of a character named Jesse or any act of saving another person's life in the passage.\nE: This option is partially correct. The passage does describe a situation where the person's eyes bulged in panic, which aligns with \"Their eyes bulged in panic.\" However, the passage is written from the first-person perspective (\"I heard nothing\"), not plural as \"they\" suggests. Still, this is the closest to what is described in the passage.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answer must reflect the silent panic experienced due to the shuttle malfunction. The only option that partially fits this description is E, despite the discrepancy in the narrative perspective (singular vs. plural).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[E]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]], "human": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}, "key": "Fiction-stories-masc-hotel-California-0.txt-3"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g5-74.txt", "qid": "8", "passage": ["Newton was the first one to suggest that gravity is universal.", "That means gravity affects all objects in the universe.", "Thats why his law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation.", "Universal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way.", "This is the reason the apple falling from the tree and the Moon being held in orbit is the same.", "Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth.", "In fact, there is gravity between you and every mass around you.", "Even tiny molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity.", "Newtons law had a huge impact on how people thought about the universe.", "It explains the motion of objects not only on Earth but in outer space as well."], "question": {"question": "What does the Law of Universal Gravitation entail?", "sentences_used": [1, 2, 3], "answers": [{"text": "Gravity affects all objects in the universe", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The force of inertia", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The gravitational force field", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Universal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The force holding us to earth", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Motion energy's impact", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "That gravity is universal and affects all objects in the universe in the same way", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Means it does not affect everyone the same way", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "8", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0.75, 0, 0.25, 1, 0.5, 0, 1, 0], "real_label": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "single_answer": [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nThat means gravity affects all objects in the universe.\nThats why his law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation.\nUniversal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Gravity affects all objects in the universe\nB: The force of inertia\nC: The gravitational force field\nD: Universal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way\nE: The force holding us to earth\nF: Motion energy's impact\nG: That gravity is universal and affects all objects in the universe in the same way\nH: Means it does not affect everyone the same way\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The passage does not provide any information about the proportion of species that still exist compared to those that have gone extinct.\n\nOption E (They can tell us about species that did not survive) is a restatement of the information provided in the passage, making it a correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers based on the passage are options B, C, and E. The answer is:##[BCE]##", "The passage discusses the significance of fossils in understanding the history of life on Earth. It highlights two key points about fossils:\n\n1. Fossils provide us with knowledge about species that did not survive.\n2. Fossils indicate that life on Earth has changed over time.\n\nNow let's analyze the options in relation to the passage:\n\nA: Whether it was land or marine - This option is not directly mentioned or implied in the passage; it discusses the general role of fossils, not their specific environment.\nB: They provide evidence of changes in species - This aligns with the second point that fossils tell us life has changed over time.\nC: Information about species that didn't survive - This matches the first point that fossils give us knowledge about species that are no longer around.\nD: Only a tiny number of species still live on Earth - The passage does not provide information about the proportion of species that currently live on Earth.\nE: They can tell us about species that did not survive - This is essentially a rephrasing of option C and matches the first point made in the passage.\nF: Whether it was hot or cold - Like option A, this is not mentioned or implied in the passage; it discusses the general role of fossils, not climate conditions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answers that align with the information provided in the passage are options B, C, and E, as they directly relate to the role of fossils in providing evidence of extinct species and the changes in life over time.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[BCE]##", "To answer this question, we must closely examine the information provided in the passages:\n\nThe first sentence indicates the importance of fossils in understanding species that did not survive. This suggests that fossils provide information about extinct species.\nThe second sentence states that fossils tell us that life on Earth has changed over time, which implies that fossils provide evidence of evolutionary changes.\nBased on this analysis, we can determine the relevance of each option:\n\nOption A (Whether it was land or marine) and F (Whether it was hot or cold) are not directly addressed in the passage. The passage does not specify the type of environment or climate associated with the fossils.\nOption B (They provide evidence of changes in species) is supported by the second sentence, which mentions that fossils tell us about changes in life over time.\nOption C (Information about species that didn't survive) is supported by the first sentence, which emphasizes the role of fossils in providing knowledge about extinct species.\nOption D (Only a tiny number of species still live on Earth) is not mentioned or implied in the passage, so it is not relevant to the given information.\nOption E (They can tell us about species that did not survive) is a restatement of the idea expressed in the first sentence of the passage.\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passages, the

mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through. Initially, the rate for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation was $25 an hour. However, as of last week, he has increased this rate to a minimum of $50 an hour.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe new rate is $50 an hour, which corresponds to option A.\nThe old rate was $25 an hour, which is mentioned in option D.\nOptions B ($400) and C ($150) are not mentioned anywhere in the passage and are therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the raised rates and the original rates are A and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##\n\n\nSample2:\n[Passages:]\nLucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird.\nShe draws a picture of her family.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Martha\nB: Lucy\n\n[Analyses:]\nAnalyzing the provided passages gives us key information about the central figure in the narrative:\n\nLucy is identified as an eight-year-old girl.\nIt's stated that Lucy lives with her parents and a pet bird.\nLucy engages in an activity where she draws a picture of her family.\nGiven this context, the task requires selecting appropriate answers from the options A (Martha) and B (Lucy). Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage. The options are: A (The equator), B (Australia), C (North pole), and D (New York).\n\nThe passage explicitly mentions \"the equator\" as the location where the described climatic conditions apply. The other options, Australia, the North Pole, and New York, are not mentioned in the passage and have varying climates that do not match the specific condition of unchanging seasons and constant average daily temperatures described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[A]##\n\nSample4:[Passages:]\nPeople seeking assistance must provide identification proving they reside in the area.\n\"They need to come in and go through our interview process,\" she said.\n\n[Options:]\nA: ID\nB: Identification that they live in the area\nC: Credit card statement\nD: Utility bill\nE: Birth Certificate\nF: Insurance\nG: Identification\n\n[Analyses:]\n"}, "response": ["The passage states that people seeking assistance must provide identification proving they reside in the area.

Proskynesis involves a symbolic kissing of the hand or prostration on the ground, which was a sign of respect to social superiors in Persian culture.\n3. The Greeks interpreted this gesture as something reserved for deities and thought Alexander was trying to deify himself by requiring it.\n4. This belief led to the loss of sympathy from many Greeks.\n5. Alexander eventually abandoned the custom of proskynesis.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options in relation to the passage:\n\nA: Usurping the province of deities - This is consistent with the passage, which states that the Greeks believed the gesture of proskynesis was reserved for deities, and by adopting it, Alexander was encroaching on that belief.\nB: For becoming Persian - The passage does not indicate that Alexander was criticized for becoming Persian, but rather for adopting certain Persian customs.\nC: For revenging himself - There is no mention of revenge in the passage.\nD: Because of his efforts to adopt some elements of Persian dress and customs, such as the kissing of the hand, which the Greeks believed meant Alex intended to deify himself - This option accurately reflects the information given in the passage.\nE: Because he thought himself a god - The passage does not state that Alexander himself thought he was a god, but that the Greeks believed he intended to deify himself.\nF: Attempting to introduce proskynesis - This is a factual statement that is directly supported by the passage.\n\nBased on the analysis, the options that align with the information in the passage are A, D, and F. Option B is incorrect because it suggests Alexander was criticized for becoming Persian rather than for adopting specific customs. Option C is not supported by the passage. Option E is misleading because it suggests Alexander's own belief rather than the Greeks' perception of his actions.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[ADF]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], "predicts": [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]], "human": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}, "key": "Wiki_articles/wikiAlexander the Great-34.txt-3"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Sept11-reports/oanc-chapter-3-2.txt", "qid": "21", "passage": ["The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).", "Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities.", "The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA.", "As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources.", "The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations.", "Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA.", "The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet.", "The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited.", "He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress.", "This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises.", "Neither is true.", "In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense.", "Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs.", "As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements."], "question": {"question": "Is it true that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises?", "sentences_used": [9, 10, 11], "answers": [{"text": "No", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Yes", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Yes, this is true", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "No it is not true.

The options are: A (The equator), B (Australia), C (North pole), and D (New York).\n\nThe passage explicitly mentions \"the equator\" as the location where the described climatic conditions apply. The other options, Australia, the North Pole, and New York, are not mentioned in the passage and have varying climates that do not match the specific condition of unchanging seasons and constant average daily temperatures described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[A]##\n\nSample4:[Passages:]\nThe most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States.\nThe U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom.\nSomething along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Bound to produce eye-popping headlines\nB: They have said nothing\nC: Something along the lines of \"this has nothing to do with us\" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip\nD: They have only supported his trips\nE: The state department declared it has nothing to do with the US\nF: The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom.

Additionally, the youngest son is mentioned, increasing the count to at least five. The mother is also mentioned, but it is not clear if she is the same as the woman sitting, so we cannot definitively say there are more than five people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[B]##", "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information given in the passage:\n\n- The passage describes a scene with a man and a woman sitting over something (presumably a stove or fire), with the man being described in detail.\n- The passage then mentions \"the man who had come home,\" suggesting a third person has entered the scene. This person provides some explanation and speaks to Babette and his mother.\n- Babette is another character who is told to be seated, indicating that she is a fourth distinct person in the scene.\n- The youngest son is mentioned as producing a bottle, which indicates that he is a fifth distinct person.\n- The passage also mentions the man's mother, who is instructed to get supper. It is not clear whether the mother is the same person as the woman sitting or a separate individual.\n\nBased on these observations, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Option A (There are only 3 people in the house) is incorrect because the passage mentions at least five distinct individuals: the man, the woman, the man who came home, Babette, and the youngest son.\n- Option B (There are at least 4 people in the house) is correct because it is the minimum number of people that can be confirmed from the passage, but we know there are at least five.\n- Option C (Five: 1. Man who came in. 2-3: Man and woman in front of a stove. 4: Babette who is standing. 5. The son. We do not know if the mother is the same person as the woman sitting in front of the stove) is also correct because it accurately reflects the information provided in the passage, acknowledging the uncertainty about whether the mother is a separate individual from the woman sitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are options B and C, as they both accurately represent the information given in the passage. The answer is:##[BC]##", "The passage describes a scene involving multiple characters:\n\n- A man and a woman are sitting over \"it\" (presumably a stove or fireplace), with the man being described in detail.\n- Another man, who seems to have just arrived home, provides a few words of explanation.\n- This man also tells Babette to be seated and asks his mother to prepare supper.\n- The youngest son is mentioned as producing a bottle of wine and another of spirits.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can identify at least five distinct individuals:\n\n1. The tall, repulsive-looking man with unkempt hair.\n2. The woman who is sitting with the man over the stove.\n3. The man who has just come home (he speaks to Babette and his mother).\n4. Babette, who is told to be seated.\n5. The youngest son, who produces the bottles.\n\nThe passage does not explicitly confirm whether the mother and the woman sitting over the stove are the same person or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say there are only three people in the house (option A) or that there are exactly four people (option B). The most accurate conclusion based on the information provided is that there are at least four people in the house, with the possibility of a fifth if the mother and the woman sitting are different individuals.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]## and ##[C]##, as both answers acknowledge there are at least four people, and option C allows for the possibility of a fifth, which cannot be ruled out based on the passage.", "The passage describes a scene involving multiple characters:\n\n- A man and a woman are initially mentioned as sitting over \"it,\" which could be a stove or some other object.\n- The man who had come home provides some explanation, indicating his arrival to the scene.\n- He speaks to Babette, telling her to be seated, which adds another person to the scene.\n- He also tells his mother to get some supper, indicating the presence of another distinct individual.\n- The youngest son is mentioned as producing a bottle, adding yet another person to the scene.\n\nFrom the passage, we can identify at least five distinct individuals:\n1. The repulsive-looking man.\n2. The woman sitting with him.\n3. The man who came home.\n4. Babette.\n5. The youngest son.\n\nThe passage also mentions \"his mother,\" but it is not explicitly clear whether the mother is the same person as the woman sitting with the repulsive-looking man or a separate individual. However, since the youngest son is mentioned separately, it suggests that the mother is likely a different person, which would bring the count to at least six individuals.\n\nGiven this analysis, the options can be evaluated as follows:\nA: There are only 3 people in the house - This is incorrect because the passage describes more than three people.\nB: There are at least 4 people in the house - This is correct; there are at least five individuals explicitly mentioned.\nC: Five: 1. Man who came in. 2-3: Man and woman in front of a stove. 4: Babette who is standing. 5. The son. We do not know if the mother is the same person as the woman sitting in front of the stove - This is partially correct; there are at least five individuals mentioned, but it does not account for the mother as a separate individual, which is a possibility.\n\nConsidering the information provided, option B is definitely correct, and option C is partially correct but incomplete as it does not consider the potential presence of the mother as a separate individual.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##", "To determine the correct answer, we must analyze the details provided in the passage about the characters present in the scene:\n\n- The passage starts by describing a man and a woman sitting over \"it,\" which likely refers to a stove or fireplace.\n- The \"man who had come home\" provides a few words of explanation, suggesting that he is a separate individual from the man already described.\n- The man who had come home speaks to Babette, telling her to be seated, indicating that Babette is another character.\n- The same man also tells his mother to get some supper, which introduces the mother as yet another character.\n- The youngest son is mentioned as producing a bottle of wine and spirits, adding yet another character to the scene.\n\nFrom the passage, we can infer the following characters are present:\n1. The repulsive-looking man.\n2. The woman sitting with the man.\n3. The man who came home.\n4. Babette.\n5. The mother (who is told to get supper).\n6. The youngest son (who produces the bottles).\n\nThe passage does not explicitly state that the mother and the woman sitting over \"it\" are different people, but since they are referred to separately, we can assume for the purpose of this question that they are indeed separate individuals.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that there are at least five people mentioned in the passage (the man, the woman, the man who came home, Babette, and the youngest son), and possibly a sixth if the mother is not the same as the woman sitting with the man.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A, as there are more than three people in the house. B is correct because there are at least four people in the house.

This is consistent with the passage.\n\nOption B includes an incomplete statement that is ambiguous and does not directly relate to the information provided in the passage.\n\nOption C uses the word \"Confidential,\" which is accurate, and mentions the website www.eeo1.com, which is also correct. However, the option is fragmented and lacks context, making it less complete than option A.\n\nOption D suggests that the companies are listed in the study available at www.eeo1.com, which contradicts the passage that states the names are confidential.\n\nOption E claims that the researchers at Rutgers are aware of the names, but there is no mention of Rutgers in the passage, nor is there any indication that the researchers know the names.\n\nOption F incorrectly states that the study can be found at bls.org, which is not mentioned in the passage.

Option B (\"Unknown to researchers, www.eeo1.com\") is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear context or statement that aligns with the passage.\n4. Option C (\"Confidential, www.eeo1.com\") is also incomplete and doesn't accurately reflect the information in the passage.\n5. Option D (\"The companies are listed in the study at www.eeo1.com\") is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that the names of the companies were not known to the researchers, implying that they are not listed in the study.\n6. Option E (\"Known to researchers at Rutgers\") is not supported by the passage, as it states that the company names were not known to the researchers.\n7.

This option directly correlates with the information provided in the passage.\n\nOption C (A plot to kill Alexander because Callisthenes led the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis) suggests a causality that the plot to kill Alexander was because Callisthenes led the opposition to proskynesis. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the plot was a direct result of Callisthenes's opposition to proskynesis, only that he had fallen out of favor for this reason. This option implies a direct causality that is not clearly established in the passage.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that most accurately reflects the content of the passage is B, as it captures both the implication of Callisthenes in the plot and the reason for his fall from favor.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##", "The passage discusses a historical event involving a plot against someone's life during the Central Asian campaign. It is important to identify who the passage refers to when mentioning \"his life\" and \"his own royal pages.\" While the passage does not directly state the name of the individual targeted in the plot, the reference to \"his official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus,\" implies that the subject is a person of significant historical importance, likely Alexander the Great, given Callisthenes' association with him.\n\nThe passage also states that Callisthenes was implicated in the plot, but historians have not reached a consensus regarding his involvement. The reason given for Callisthenes falling out of favor is his leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis, which was a practice of showing reverence by bowing or prostrating oneself.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA: The Central Asian campaign - This option refers to the location or context of the event, which is mentioned in the passage.\nB: He was implicated in a second plot against Alexander's life because he had fallen out of favor by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis - This option suggests a causal relationship between Callisthenes' opposition to proskynesis and his implication in the plot. The passage does indicate that Callisthenes had fallen out of favor and was implicated in the plot, but it does not explicitly state that the opposition to proskynesis was the reason for his implication in the plot.\nC: A plot to kill Alexander because Callisthenes led the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis - This option also suggests a causal relationship, similar to option B. However, the passage does not confirm that the plot to kill Alexander was directly because of Callisthenes' opposition to proskynesis, only that he had fallen out of favor possibly due to his opposition.\n\nBased on the passage, option A is the only one that can be directly confirmed as it mentions the Central Asian campaign, which is stated in the passage. Options B and C suggest a causal relationship that the passage does not explicitly confirm.

This option aligns with the passage's information that Callisthenes led the opposition to proskynesis and had fallen out of favor, which could be a reason for his implication in the plot.\n\nOption C (A plot to kill Alexander because Callisthenes led the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis) also suggests a causal relationship but is not explicitly stated in the passage. It is implied that Callisthenes' opposition to proskynesis is related to the plot, but the passage does not directly state that the plot was to kill Alexander or that it was specifically because Callisthenes led the opposition.\n\nBased on the passage, the most accurate option that captures the involvement of Callisthenes and the reason for his implication in the plot is Option B.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##", "The passage discusses a historical event, specifically a second plot against someone's life during the Central Asian campaign. The text mentions that this plot was instigated by the individual's own royal pages and that Callisthenes of Olynthus, the official historian, was implicated in the plot. However, historians have not reached a consensus on his involvement. Additionally, it is mentioned that Callisthenes had fallen out of favor due to leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.\n\nBased on the passage, we can analyze the options as follows:\n\nA: The Central Asian campaign is mentioned in the passage as the context in which the second plot against the individual's life was revealed. This option is a correct reference to the passage.\nB: This option suggests that Callisthenes was implicated in the second plot because he had fallen out of favor for leading the opposition to proskynesis. The passage does indicate that Callisthenes had fallen out of favor for this reason, and he was implicated in the plot, but it does not explicitly state that this was the reason for his implication in the plot.\nC: This option suggests a direct causation, stating that there was a plot to kill Alexander because Callisthenes led the opposition to proskynesis. While the passage does connect Callisthenes' falling out of favor with his opposition to proskynesis, it does not directly state that the plot to kill Alexander was because of this opposition.\n\nGiven the passage's information, we can conclude that option A is the only one that is directly and indisputably supported by the text.

This information aligns with option B.\n- The passage provides a reason for Callisthenes falling out of favor, which was his leadership in opposing the introduction of proskynesis. This opposition is linked to his implication in the plot, which supports option B.\n- Option C is a rephrased statement that combines the implication of Callisthenes in the plot with the reason for his fall from favor, which is also supported by the passage.\n\nBased on the passage, we can deduce that:\n- The Central Asian campaign is the context for the second plot (option A).\n- Callisthenes was implicated in the plot, and the reason given for his implication is his opposition to the introduction of proskynesis (option B).\n- The plot to kill Alexander is mentioned in the passage, and the reason for Callisthenes' implication is his opposition to proskynesis (option C).\n\nTherefore, the correct answers based on the information provided in the passage are options A, B, and C.\n\nThe answer is:##[ABC]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]], "human": [0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Wiki_articles/wikiAlexander the Great-34.txt-1"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction-stories/mctest-mc160.train.64-0.txt", "qid": "2", "passage": ["A day at the beach.", "When Sam woke in the morning, he was super excited!", "Today was the day!", "It was Sunday, the day that Sam's mom and dad had promised to take Sam to the beach.", "Sam's grandma had given a pail and shovel to Sam to use in the sand.", "At breakfast Sam was so excited he was wiggling in his seat!", "Mom told Sam that they would leave when the big hand on the clock was pointing to the 10, and the little had was pointing to the 12.", "Mom asked Sam if he would like to help make sandwiches for the trip, and Sam said that he wanted to help.", "Dad said, \"let's make a game of it, we need to make a sandwich for each of us.", "There are three of us, so we need three sandwiches.", "Let's count as we make the sandwiches!\"", "Sam counted as mom made the sandwiches, one for dad, one for mom and one for Sam.", "Then mom started to make another sandwich!", "\"Mom!\"", "said Sam, \"we have three sandwiches and that makes one sandwich for each of us.\"", "Sam's mom laughed, \"You're right Sam!\"", "Sam's mom said she was being silly."], "question": {"question": "What was Sam's game with the sandwiches?", "sentences_used": [9, 10, 11, 8], "answers": [{"text": "Counting", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "He was counting the sandwiches his mom made", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "He made the sandwiches as his mom counted", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "He was eating the sandwiches his mom made", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Game", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "He stared at the clock as his mom made sandwiches", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "2", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0.5, 0], "real_label": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "single_answer": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nThere are three of us, so we need three sandwiches.\nLet's count as we make the sandwiches!\"\nSam counted as mom made the sandwiches, one for dad, one for mom and one for Sam.\nDad said, \"let's make a game of it, we need to make a sandwich for each of us.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Counting\nB: He was counting the sandwiches his mom made\nC: He made the sandwiches as his mom counted\nD: He was eating the sandwiches his mom made\nE: Game\nF: He stared at the clock as his mom made sandwiches\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

Although the use of the apostrophe is not necessary and is often considered incorrect when denoting age, it is still a representation of the age range mentioned in the passage.\nOption C (\"Younger than thirty\") is incorrect because the passage states the victim was in his 30s, not younger.\nOption D (\"At least 50\") is incorrect because it states an age range that is higher than what is indicated in the passage.\nOption E (\"Between 30 and 40\") is a more specific age range within the 30s and is also correct based on the passage.\nTherefore, the correct answers based on the information provided are options that accurately reflect the age range of the victim as stated by the police.

This information directly matches option A (In his thirties) and option B (In his 30's), which are two different ways of stating the same age range. Option E (Between 30 and 40) also corresponds to the same age range, albeit slightly more specific.\n\nOption C (Younger than thirty) and option D (At least 50) do not match the information provided in the passage, as they suggest age ranges that are outside the victim's stated age range of \"in his 30s.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided in the passage, are: The answer is:##[ABE]##", "The passage provides specific details regarding the age and the status of the victim mentioned:\n\n- The victim is described as being \"in his 30s,\" which indicates that he is somewhere in the age range of thirty to thirty-nine years old.\n- The passage also notes that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene and that his identity has not been disclosed as efforts are being made to contact his next of kin.\n\nBased on this information, we can evaluate the provided options:\n\nA: \"In his thirties\" is a paraphrase of \"in his 30s,\" which is stated in the passage.\nB: \"In his 30's\" is another way of writing \"in his 30s,\" which is consistent with the information given.\nC: \"Younger than thirty\" contradicts the information provided, as the victim is specifically mentioned to be in his 30s.\nD: \"At least 50\" is incorrect because it suggests an age range that is higher than what is stated in the passage.\nE: \"Between 30 and 40\" is accurate because \"in his 30s\" implies an age within this range.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the victim's age range are A, B, and E.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[ABE]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "predicts": [[1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]], "human": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}, "key": "News/CNN/cnn-3b659823a1b4208f0990ed2db4a293095c576458.txt-4"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Wiki_articles/wikiAlexander the Great-34.txt", "qid": "13", "passage": ["During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors.", "The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it.", "This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.", "A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander.", "The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance.", "Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.", "Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages.", "His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot;

Option C (Agility/Agile) is the only option that directly corresponds to the term used in the passage to describe the CIA's reputation.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage provided, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[C]##", "The passage discusses the reputation of the CIA, specifically noting its \"agility in operations.\" It then goes on to question whether these stereotypes (agility) still match the current reality or if they might be a symptom of the misunderstandings described earlier in chapter 4. The key term to focus on here is \"agility,\" which implies being able to move quickly and easily.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\nA: Methodical and cumbersome - This choice suggests a slow and heavy way of doing things, which is the opposite of agility.\nB: Secretive and redundant - While the CIA may be secretive due to the nature of its work, the term \"redundant\" does not relate to agility, and secrecy is not mentioned in the passage.\nC: Agility/Agile - This option directly matches the term used in the passage to describe the CIA's reputation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer that aligns with the passage's description of the CIA's reputation is \"agility,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##", "The passage provides information about the reputation of the CIA:\n\nThe CIA is reputed to have agility in operations.\nThere is uncertainty about whether this stereotype still matches the current reality.\nThe text also mentions civil-military misunderstandings discussed in chapter 4, but this does not directly relate to the options provided.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that correspond to the information given in the passage. The options are: A (Methodical and cumbersome), B (Secretive and redundant), and C (Agility/Agile).\n\nThe passage explicitly mentions \"agility in operations\" as a characteristic associated with the CIA's reputation. Therefore, option C directly reflects the information provided in the passage. Options A and B suggest characteristics that are not mentioned in the passage and do not reflect the stated reputation of the CIA for being agile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[C]##", "The passage discusses the reputation of the CIA, specifically highlighting its agility in operations. The text then raises the question of whether this reputation accurately reflects the current reality, suggesting that it may be a symptom of misunderstandings, as described in a previous chapter.\n\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage. The options are: A (Methodical and cumbersome), B (Secretive and redundant), and C (Agility/Agile).\n\nThe passage specifically uses the word \"agility\" to describe the CIA's reputation. This directly corresponds to option C. Options A and B introduce descriptors that are not mentioned in the passage and do not align with the specific attribute of agility that is highlighted in the text.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer,

Option C (He loses his memory every 15 minutes) provides a specific time frame that is not stated in the passage. Option E (His is suffering from anterograde amnesia) may seem plausible due to the description of memory loss, but the term \"anterograde amnesia\" is not used in the passage, so we cannot assume it without further context. Option F (Want to kill everyone) is too broad and does not match the specific motive of avenging Kalpana's death.

This corresponds to option A.\n- The reason for Sanjay's actions is revealed to be his desire to avenge the death of his sweetheart, Kalpana. He is systematically killing the people responsible for her death. This aligns with options D and H.\n- There is no mention of Sanjay losing his memory every 15 minutes, performing ritualistic homage to the God of Islam, wanting to kill everyone indiscriminately, or using tattoos to decorate his body. Therefore, options B, C, F, and G are not supported by the text.\n- Option E suggests that Sanjay is suffering from anterograde amnesia. While the passage doesn't explicitly use the term \"anterograde amnesia,\" the description of Sanjay's need to recover his memory after each cycle suggests a memory disorder consistent with anterograde amnesia. However, since the term is not directly used in the passage, it's not as strong an answer as the others that are explicitly mentioned.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answers are A, D, and H, as they are directly supported by the text.

Option A is a rephrasing of the situation described in the passage, indicating the reliance on proxies instead of proper training of U.S. personnel. Option E is likely a typographical error for \"CIA operatives,\" which is mentioned in the passage. Options F and G are not relevant as they are not mentioned in the passage. Option H is indirectly related because the passage does talk about the lack of military training, but it does not specifically mention the military itself.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the reliance on proxies, lack of training, and the unsatisfactory results are A, B, C, D, and E (assuming E is intended to be \"CIA operatives\").\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[ABCDE]##", "The passage discusses the use of proxies in a particular context:\n\n- The term \"proxies\" suggests the use of substitute or intermediary forces rather than direct involvement.\n- It is mentioned that these proxies were organized by CIA operatives who lacked \"the requisite military training.\"\n- The outcome of using these proxies was deemed \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\nGiven these points, we can evaluate the provided options:\n\nA: This option states \"relying on proxies instead of training U.S. personnel for paramilitary operations,\" which aligns with the passage's mention of using proxies and the lack of military training.\nB: \"Training\" is mentioned in the passage as something the CIA operatives lacked, but the option does not provide full context.\nC: \"CIA's relying on proxies to conduct paramilitary operations\" directly corresponds to the passage's content.\nD: \"The result\" is mentioned as being unsatisfactory, but the option does not provide full context.\nE: \"Cbi operatives\" seems to be a typographical error and should likely read \"CIA operatives,\" which is mentioned in the passage.\nF: \"War on Afghanistan\" is not mentioned in the passage and has no direct relevance to the content provided.\nG: \"The CIA-military join teams cooperation\" is not mentioned or implied in the passage.\nH: \"Military\" is referenced in the context of the lack of training, but the option does not provide full context.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answers that align with the content are the use of proxies by the CIA and the lack of military training, which are reflected in options A and C.

Although \"hair styling\" could be inferred as part of the broader category of \"their hair,\" the passage does not explicitly mention styling, so we should stick to the information provided.\n\nGiven the information in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the context is \"their hair,\" which corresponds to option D.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "The passage from OPRAH.com provides specific information about Chris Rock and a particular topic he discusses:\n\nChris Rock is introduced as an Emmy-winning comedian and family man.\nThe passage then shifts to a new aspect of Rock's commentary, focusing on women and their hair.\nRock states that because women invest a lot of time and money into their hair, men have to maintain a hands-off approach.\nBased on the information provided, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that are directly related to the passage. The options are: A (Their clothes), B (Their makeup), C (Food), D (Their hair), E (Buying things), and F (Hair Styling).\n\nThe passage specifically mentions women's hair as the subject of Rock's comments. Therefore, options A (Their clothes), B (Their makeup), and C (Food) are not relevant to the specific topic mentioned. Option E (Buying things) is somewhat related but is not as specific as option D (Their hair), which is the direct subject of the passage. Option F (Hair Styling) is also related to the topic of hair, but the passage does not explicitly mention styling; it focuses on the time and money spent on hair, which could include but is not limited to styling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided in the passage, is: The answer is:##[D]##", "The passage provides specific information about Chris Rock's commentary on a particular aspect of women's grooming habits:\n\nChris Rock is introduced as an Emmy-winning comedian and family man, but the passage suggests there's a new aspect of him to be known.\nRock makes a statement about women spending a lot of time and money on something, which leads to men having a \"hands-off policy.\"\nThe passage directly mentions that women spend time and money on \"their hair.\"\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the correct answer must be related to what the passage states women spend a lot of time and money on.

The narrator mentions leaving the tower at daybreak with a candle from the study, indicating the setting may be an old building with a study room and a tower.\n2. The narrator reassures themselves about the safety of the cellars, which can only be entered through a heavy oaken door.\n3. The key to this door is always carried by the narrator, suggesting a role that involves responsibility for the security and access to certain areas of the building.\n\nBased on these clues, we can eliminate some options:\n\n- A teacher (A) is not indicated by any specific detail in the passage.\n- A prince (B) would not typically carry keys to a building or be concerned with the security of cellars.\n- A policeman (C) is not directly suggested, as the passage does not mention any law enforcement activities.\n- A keeper (D) could be a possibility as it implies someone who has a caretaking or guarding role.\n- A wine maker (E) is plausible since wine cellars require secure storage, and a wine maker might carry keys to these areas.\n- It's unclear (F) is an option if none of the roles can be determined from the context.\n- A guard (G) or security guard (H) could also be possibilities since both roles involve ensuring the safety of a location and carrying keys.\n- A philosopher (I) is not suggested by any details in the passage.\n\nThe most likely roles based on the passage are those related to security or caretaking, such as a keeper, a guard, or a security guard. The role of a wine maker is less likely but possible if we consider the context of cellars typically being used to store wine. However, the passage does not provide explicit information about the nature of the cellars (whether they are wine cellars or not). Therefore, the best answers would be those related to security or caretaking.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[DFGH]##", "The passage provides a narrative context with some clues as to the occupation or role of the person speaking:\n\n1. The speaker mentions leaving a tower at daybreak, which suggests a location that could be associated with various professions or roles.\n2. The speaker refers to \"the study candles,\" which implies that there is a study room, a place typically associated with reading, writing, or academic work, but not necessarily indicative of a specific profession.\n3. The speaker talks about making 'rounds,' which could imply a routine check or patrol, often associated with security-related roles.\n4. The speaker reassures themselves that the cellars are safe because they can only be entered through a heavy oaken door, and the speaker carries the key, suggesting a protective or custodial role.\n5. The term \"cellars\" could suggest a connection to wine, but the context does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the speaker is a wine maker.\n\nBased on these clues, we can infer that the speaker is likely in a role that involves some level of security or custodianship, as they carry a key to a secure area and make rounds. Options A (teacher), B (prince), and I (philosopher) do not fit well with the clues provided. Option C (policeman) could be a possibility due to the security aspect, but the context of a tower and study does not align perfectly with typical policing duties. Option D (keeper) fits well with the custodial aspect and the responsibility for keys. Options E (wine maker) is not strongly supported by the text. Options G (guard) and H (security guard) also align with the security aspect, but the context of a tower and study might be less common for these roles.\n\nSince the passage does not provide explicit information about the speaker's profession and there are multiple plausible options based on the clues provided, the most accurate answer is that it's unclear. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is:##[F]##", "The passage provides a narrative in which the speaker describes leaving a tower at daybreak with a candle for light and mentions the security of the cellars, which can only be entered through a heavy oaken door, the key to which the speaker always carries.\n\nTo determine the most appropriate answer(s) from the given options, we should consider the details provided:\n\n- The speaker left a tower early in the morning with a candle, which suggests that they may have some responsibility for the place, as they are moving around before it is light.\n- The mention of \"study candles\" might imply that the location has a study, which could be a place of learning or work.\n- The speaker reassures themselves about the safety of the cellars, which they can access with a key they always carry, suggesting a protective or custodial role over the premises.\n- The speaker does not mention teaching, ruling, policing, or philosophizing as part of their duties.\n\nBased on these details, the most fitting options related to someone who might have the responsibility of carrying keys and ensuring the security of a location would be a keeper (D), guard (G), or security guard (H). A teacher (A), prince (B), policeman (C), wine maker (E), and philosopher (I) are less likely given the context, and the option \"It's unclear\" (F) could be considered if none of the roles fit perfectly. However, since the speaker's role involves carrying keys and ensuring the safety of the cellars, it is reasonable to infer that they are in a protective or custodial role.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided and the roles that align with the responsibilities mentioned, are: The answer is:##[DGH]##", "The passage provides a narrative describing the actions and circumstances of the speaker:\n\n- The speaker left the tower early in the morning when it was still dark.\n- The speaker needed a candle to see because it was too dark inside the house.\n- The speaker reassures themselves about the safety of the cellars, which can only be accessed through a heavy oaken door.\n- The speaker carries the key to this door on their person at all times.\n\nBased on these details, we can infer certain characteristics about the speaker's role:\n\n- The mention of a tower and the need for a light suggests a setting that is not typical of a modern home, which might hint at a role such as a keeper or guard (options D, G, and H).\n- The fact that the speaker carries a key to a heavy oaken door that leads to cellars could imply a protective or custodial role, which again points to options D (a keeper), G (guard), or H (security guard).\n- There is no explicit information to suggest the speaker is a teacher (A), prince (B), policeman (C), wine maker (E), or philosopher (I).\n- Option F (It's unclear) is a possible choice if the passage does not provide enough information to conclusively determine the speaker's role.\n\nGiven the context of ensuring safety and carrying a key to a secured area, the most likely roles would be those associated with protection or custody of the premises, such as a keeper, guard, or security guard.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[DGH]##", "The passage provides some context clues about the occupation or role of the narrator:\n\n- The narrator mentions leaving a tower at daybreak and needing a candle to see, indicating they were in a place that was dark and possibly old or traditional in structure.\n- The narrator also speaks of making a 'round, which suggests some form of routine inspection or patrol.\n- The mention of reassurance about the safety of the cellars and that they can only be entered through a heavy oaken door, for which the narrator carries the key, suggests a role of responsibility for the security or maintenance of the premises.\n- No specific occupation like teacher, prince, policeman, wine maker, or philosopher is directly mentioned or implied with sufficient evidence in the passage.\n\nBased on these clues, the most likely roles related to security or maintenance would be a keeper (someone who has the keys and looks after a place), a guard, or a security guard. These roles are consistent with carrying keys, making rounds, and ensuring the security of a location. The option \"It's unclear\" could also be a potential answer if one argues that the passage does not provide enough specific information to conclusively determine the exact occupation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, could include D (a keeper), G (guard), H (security guard), and potentially F (it's unclear) if one considers the information too vague for a definitive occupation.\n\nThe answer is:##[DGH]## or ##[DGHF]## if including the possibility of unclear occupation."], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg-10002.txt-12"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction/gutenberg-10002.txt", "qid": "14", "passage": ["The day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of the study candles with me on my 'round.", "By the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.", "My search had shown me nothing fresh.", "Everything appeared to be in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars.", "I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty search on the evening of the attack.", "For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated.", "I would have been very willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the cellars are the hugest and weirdest.", "Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.", "Yet, I would not shirk the work.", "I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.", "Besides, as I reassured myself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which to come across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered, only through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, I carry always on my person."], "question": {"question": "What was he doing on the ground floor?", "sentences_used": [0, 1], "answers": [{"text": "Reading", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Sleeping", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Searching", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Making his rounds", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Cooking", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Looking for the key to the cellar", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Cleaning", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "14", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "real_label": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "single_answer": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nThe day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of the study candles with me on my 'round.\nBy the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Reading\nB: Sleeping\nC: Searching\nD: Making his rounds\nE: Cooking\nF: Looking for the key to the cellar\nG: Cleaning\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

points, we can infer the following:\n\n- The collapse did not happen at \"6:00 PM\" (option A) because that would be two hours after the stated time of the incident.\n- It did not happen \"After 4pm\" (option B) because the passage specifies \"around 4 p.m.\"\n- \"Around 8pm\" (option C) is incorrect because it is four hours after the incident.\n- \"4 p.m\" (option D) is a possible answer because it is a common way to denote the time mentioned, albeit without the approximation.\n- \"Around 4pm\" (option E) is the most accurate answer as it matches the passage's description.\n- \"Exactly 4am\" (option F) is incorrect because it specifies the wrong time of day (AM instead of PM).\n- \"4:00 PM\" (option G) could be considered correct as it is the same time as mentioned in the passage, but it

However, the specific time of departure is 10:10, not exactly at 10, and there's no mention of the number of sandwiches.\n- Option D is incorrect because it states they left at ten, which is not the precise time given in the passage (10:10), and there's no information about the number of sandwiches.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the departure time and the fact that they took sandwiches with them is C, although it should be noted that the exact departure time is slightly off.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[C]##", "To answer this question, we need to carefully examine the information given in the passage:\n\n- The mother told Sam that they would leave when the big hand on the clock was pointing to the 10 and the little hand was pointing to the 12. In standard analog clock reading, this would indicate a time of 10 o'clock, not noon (which would be when the little hand is on the 12 and the big hand is on the 6).\n- The mother asked Sam if he wanted to help make sandwiches for the trip, and Sam agreed to help. However, there is no specific information provided about the number of sandwiches they took with them.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because it incorrectly states that they left at noon.\n- Option B is also incorrect for the same reason as A, stating they left at noon.\n- Option C is partially correct; they would leave at 10, but there is no mention of the number of sandwiches, so we cannot confirm the entire statement.\n- Option D is incorrect as it specifies they left at ten, which is correct, but it also mentions taking three sandwiches, which is not supported by any information in the passage.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the only partially correct answer that aligns with the time they planned to leave is option C, but it includes an unsupported detail about sandwiches.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]## (with the caveat that the number of sandwiches is not verified by the passage).", "In this passage, we are provided with two pieces of information:\n\n1. The departure time is indicated by the position of the clock hands: the big hand is on the 10 and the little hand is on the 12.\n2. Sam agrees to help make sandwiches for the trip.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to understand how to read a clock. The big hand represents minutes, and when it points to the 10, it indicates that it is 50 minutes past the hour. The little hand represents hours, and when it points to the 12, it indicates the hour is 12. Therefore, they would leave at 12:50, not at noon (12:00) or at 10:00.\n\nNone of the given options explicitly states they would leave at 12:50. However, option C is closest to the correct departure time, as it mentions they would leave at 10, which can be inferred from the context to mean the big hand is on the 10, not that the time is 10:00. Additionally, the passage does not provide any information about the number of sandwiches made or taken with them, so we cannot select any option that includes a specific number of sandwiches.\n\nGiven the information in the passage, the correct answer is:\nThe answer is:##[C]##", "To answer this question, we must analyze the information provided in the passages:\n\n1. Mom tells Sam they would leave when the big hand on the clock points to 10, and the little hand points to 12.\n2. Mom asks Sam if he wants to help make sandwiches for the trip, and Sam agrees to help.\n\nBased on the first point, we can determine the time they planned to leave. The big hand pointing to 10 indicates minutes, and the little hand pointing to 12 indicates hours. This means they planned to leave at 10 minutes past the hour when the little hand is on 12, which is a way of saying 10 minutes past 12 or 12:10. None of the options mention leaving at 12:10, so we must look for other clues.\n\nThe second point tells us that Sam agreed to help make sandwiches, but it does not specify how many sandwiches they made or took with them.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA: They left at noon, and took four sandwiches with them.\nB: They left at noon, and took three sandwiches with them.\nC: They would leave at 10 and take sandwiches with them.\nD: They left at ten, and took three sandwiches with them.\n\nOption A suggests they left at noon, but the passage indicates they planned to leave at 12:10, not noon.\nOption B also suggests a noon departure, which is incorrect.\nOption C says they would leave at 10, which could be misinterpreted as 10 o'clock, but in the context of the passage, it means 10 minutes past the hour, so this option is partially correct; however, it does not specify how many sandwiches they took, which is not stated in the passage.\nOption D says they left at ten, which could mean 10 o'clock, which is incorrect.\n\nSince none of the options perfectly match the information provided in the passages, and the number of sandwiches is not specified, the most accurate option based on the departure time is C, as it correctly refers to leaving at 10 minutes past the hour. The part about taking sandwiches is correct, but we must ignore the specific count as it is not provided in the passages.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##", "The passage provides specific details about the time of departure and an activity related to the trip:\n\n1. The departure time is indicated by the position of the clock hands:\n   - The big hand is pointing to the 10.\n   - The little hand is pointing to the 12.\n   This corresponds to 10 o'clock, not noon (which would be indicated by both hands pointing to the 12).\n\n2. Sam is asked by his mother if he would like to help make sandwiches for the trip, and Sam agrees to help. However, the passage does not specify the number of sandwiches they took with them.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude the following:\n- Option A is incorrect because it specifies that they left at noon, which contradicts the departure time described in the passage.\n- Option B is also incorrect for the same reason as option A, as it incorrectly states the departure time as noon.\n- Option C is partially correct in stating that they would leave at 10, which aligns with the clock hands' positions. However, it is incomplete as it does not mention whether they actually took sandwiches with them, only that Sam wanted to help make them.\n- Option D is incorrect because it states that they left at ten, which is correct, but it also mentions taking three sandwiches, a detail that is not provided in the passage.\n\nBased on the accurate information provided in the passage about the departure time and the activity of making sandwiches without specifying the number, the closest correct answer is C, as it correctly identifies the planned departure time and includes the making of sandwiches.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 0, 0], "predicts": [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 1, 1]}, "key": "Fiction-stories/mctest-mc160.train.64-0.txt-18"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "wikiMovieSummaries-2444093.txt", "qid": "16", "passage": ["In 2415 , after a virus in 2011 wiped out 99 % of the Earth's population , all of the survivors inhabit Bregna , a walled city-state , Which is ruled by a congress of scientists .", "Although Bregna is idyllic , people are routinely disappearing and everyone is suffering from bad dreams .", "on Flux is a member of the ` Monicans ' , an underground rebel organization who communicate through telepathy-enabling technology and are led by The Handler .", "After a mission to destroy a surveillance station , on comes home to find her sister Una has been killed for being mistaken for a Monican .", "When on is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader , Trevor Goodchild , she discovers that both she and the Monicans are being manipulated by council members in a secret coup .", "This discovery causes on to question the origins of everyone in Bregna ; and in particular , her own personal connection to Trevor .", "It turns out that everyone in Bregna is actually a clone , grown from recycled DNA .", "With the dead constantly being reborn into new individuals and still bearing partial memories of their previous lives , there has been an increase in the troubling dreams .", "Recycling and cloning became necessary since the original viral antidote made humans infertile .", "Trevor's ongoing experiments , as with all his clone ancestors , has been trying to reverse the infertility .", "on learns that she is a clone of the original Trevor's wife , Katherine and is the first Katherine clone in over 400 years .", "One of Trevor's experiments , Una , was successful as she became pregnant ."], "question": {"question": "What are possibilities of previous lives?", "sentences_used": [7, 8], "answers": [{"text": "Virus", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Partial memories of their previous lives", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Recycling and Cloning", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Babies", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Dreams are memories", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "DNA", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "16", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 0.75, 0.75, 0, 0.5, 0.25], "real_label": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], "single_answer": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nWith the dead constantly being reborn into new individuals and still bearing partial memories of their previous lives , there has been an increase in the troubling dreams .\nRecycling and cloning became necessary since the original viral antidote made humans infertile .\n\n[Options:]\nA: Virus\nB: Partial memories of their previous lives\nC: Recycling and Cloning\nD: Babies\nE: Dreams are memories\nF: DNA\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage.

This correlates with option C (Hans's younger brother), option F (The 2nd son), and option G (Eduard).\n- In 1914, the couple separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. This part of the passage refers to option B (The father), option D (Maric, which is likely a reference to Einstein's wife, Mileva Mari\u0107), and option H (Einstein).\n\nOption E (Elsa) is not mentioned in the passage.

This corresponds to option A (Hans).\n- Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich in July 1910. This corresponds to option G (Eduard) and since Eduard is Hans's younger brother, option C (Hans's younger brother) also applies.\n- In 1914, Einstein and his wife separated; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. The father, in this case, is Einstein, which corresponds to option B (The father) and H (Einstein). The wife who remained in Zurich with their sons is not named in the passage, but we can infer that she is the mother of Hans and Eduard. Since the name Maric is provided in the options and no other female names are associated with Einstein in the passage, we can infer that Maric is likely the mother, corresponding to option D (Maric).

The second passage provides additional context, indicating that Andrews is a sponsor to someone, but it doesn't directly inform the action of sitting or standing.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\nA: The judge is here\nB: Stand up\nC: Sit down\n\nOption A (\"The judge is here\") is not mentioned in either of the passages and does not relate to the action being discussed (sitting down or standing up).\nOption B (\"Stand up\") is the opposite of what Andrews instructed, so it cannot be the correct answer.\nOption C (\"Sit down\") directly reflects the instruction given by Andrews in the first passage.\n\nBased on the analysis of the passages, the correct answer is the one that matches Andrews' instruction, which is to sit down.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]], "human": [1, 0, 0]}, "key": "Fiction-stories-masc-A_Wasted_Day-5.txt-2"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g4-5.txt", "qid": "4", "passage": ["In many parts of the world, trees lose their leaves in autumn.", "The leaves turn color.", "Then fall from the trees to the ground.", "As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy.", "While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy.", "When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy?", "Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy.", "This stored energy is called potential energy.", "An object has potential energy because of its position.", "For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall.", "They fall because of the pull of gravity.", "Potential energy can be transferred into motion.", "Motion can also be turned back into potential energy.", "Objects have potential energy due to their position.", "A leaf on a tree branch has potential energy.", "The leafs energy can be turned into motion as it falls.", "Once the leaf is on the ground, it has no more potential unless it is lifted back up."], "question": {"question": "What kind of energy do leaves have while still on the trees?", "sentences_used": [4, 5, 6, 7], "answers": [{"text": "kinetic energy", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Falling energy", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Solar energy", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Futuristic kind of energy", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Stored energy", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Potential energy", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Motion energy", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "4", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0.25, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.25, 0], "real_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "single_answer": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nWhile they are still attached to the trees they also have energy.\nWhen they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy?\nInstead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy.\nThis stored energy is called potential energy.\n\n[Options:]\nA: kinetic energy\nB: Falling energy\nC: Solar energy\nD: Futuristic kind of energy\nE: Stored energy\nF: Potential energy\nG: Motion energy\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through. Initially, the rate for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation was $25 an hour. However, as of last week, he has increased this rate to a minimum of $50 an hour.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe new rate is $50 an hour, which corresponds to option A.\nThe old rate was $25 an hour, which is mentioned in option D.\nOptions B ($400) and C ($150) are not mentioned anywhere in the passage and are therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the raised rates and the original rates are A and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##\n\n\nSample2:\n[Passages:]\nLucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird.\nShe draws a picture of her family.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Martha\nB: Lucy\n\n[Analyses:]\nAnalyzing the provided passages gives us key information about the central figure in the narrative:\n\nLucy is identified as an eight-year-old girl.\nIt's stated that Lucy lives with her parents and a pet bird.\nLucy engages in an activity where she draws a picture of her family.\nGiven this context, the task requires selecting appropriate answers from the options A (Martha) and B (Lucy). Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage.

The passage specifically states that the energy is not kinetic, which eliminates option A and G, and it does not mention falling, solar, or any futuristic kind of energy, which eliminates options B, C, and D.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answers are E and F. So, The answer is:##[EF]##", "The passage discusses the concept of energy as it pertains to objects that are attached to trees.

Smith practiced law for a living until 1982.\n\nWe can use this information to deduce the correct time-related answers. However, without knowing the current year in the context of the passage, we cannot determine the exact year when Smith started offering free legal help. We can only infer that it was 20 years ago from an unspecified current year. Nevertheless, we can determine when he stopped practicing law for a living, which is 1982, corresponding to option B.\n\nOptions A (1997), C (1980), D (2010), E (2000), and F (2017) can be considered incorrect because they either do not align with the information given or require additional context not provided in the passage to be verified.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the information about when Smith practiced law for a living is B (1982).\n\nSo, The answer is:##[B]##", "To answer this question, we need to determine the year when attorney Richard M. Smith started helping senior citizens with their legal needs for free, based on the information provided in the passage:\n\nThe passage states that for the past 20 years, Richard M. Smith has been providing free legal help to senior citizens.\nWe also know that Smith practiced law for a living until 1982.\nTo find out when he started helping seniors for free, we need to calculate 20 years back from the knowledge cutoff date, which is 2023. Subtracting 20 years from 2023 gives us 2003.\n\nNow, we have to match this information with the options provided:\n\nA: 1997 - This is before the calculated start year of 2003.\nB: 1982 - This is the year Smith stopped practicing law for a living, not when he started helping seniors for free.\nC: 1980 - This is before 1982, so it's not relevant to when he started providing free help.\nD: 2010 - This is after the calculated start year of 2003.\nE: 2000 - This is before the calculated start year of 2003.\nF: 2017 - This is after the calculated start year of 2003 and does not represent the past 20 years from the knowledge cutoff date.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the options directly match the calculated year of 2003. However, since we are looking for the time when Smith started offering free legal help, which is about 20 years ago from 2023, we can infer that none of the options provided are correct. \n\nTherefore, there is no correct answer given the options provided. If forced to choose from the incorrect options, the closest (but still incorrect) option would be E: 2000, as it is the closest date before the actual year of 2003.

If Smith has been helping senior citizens for the past 20 years from 2023, that means he started offering free legal help in 2003 (2023 - 20 = 2003).\n\nThe second piece of information states that Smith practiced law for a living until 1982. This year is explicitly mentioned in the passage and corresponds to option B.\n\nThe other options provided (A: 1997, D: 2010, E: 2000, F: 2017) are not supported by the information in the passages. Since the passage does not mention the current year, we cannot assume that the year 2017 (option F) is relevant to the context. The year 2000 (option E) is also not relevant because it is not the year when Smith started helping senior citizens for free; that year is 2003, which is not listed as an option. Options A (1997) and D (2010) are also not mentioned in the passage and are not relevant to the provided information.\n\nTherefore, based on the passages, the correct answer is the year Smith stopped practicing law for a living, which is 1982.

However, option B could be considered related to the \"adulterous fling\" mentioned in the passage, although it does not capture the full scope of the information provided.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to identify the key events and characters from the provided passage:\n\n- Emery Simms is described as a highly educated and successful business tycoon.\n- His life changes for the worse after engaging in an adulterous fling with Allanah, who is characterized as wildly free-spirited and exotic.\n- Emery kills a man who was attempting to extract information from him.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options in relation to the passage:\n\nA: Crazy man enters and attacks Emery - There is no mention in the passage of a crazy man entering and attacking Emery.\nB: Emery and Allanah make love - The passage mentions an adulterous fling between Emery and Allanah, which could imply that they make love, but it is not explicitly stated in the passage.\nC: A crazy man attacks Emery, and Allanah and Emery have dinner - The passage does not mention a crazy man attacking Emery or that Allanah and Emery have dinner together.\nD: A crazy man - The passage does not mention a crazy man; it only states that Emery kills a man trying to get information out of him.\nE: The police - The passage does not mention the police.\n\nBased on the passage, we can infer that Emery and Allanah likely had an intimate relationship, as suggested by the term \"adulterous fling.\" However, since the passage does not explicitly state that they make love, we must be careful with our inference. The passage does not provide enough information to definitively select option B, and the other options are not supported by the passage at all.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is:\nThe answer is:##[B]##", "The passages provide specific details about the character Emery Simms and his actions:\n\n- Emery Simms is described as a highly educated and successful business tycoon.\n- His life changes for the worse after an adulterous fling with Allanah, who is characterized as wildly free-spirited and exotic.\n- Emery kills a man who was attempting to extract information from him.\n\nBased on these details, we can analyze the options provided to determine which one(s) are accurate:\n\nOption A suggests that a crazy man enters and attacks Emery. There is no mention of Emery being attacked by a crazy man in the passages; therefore, this option is not supported by the text.\nOption B states that Emery and Allanah make love. While the passage does mention an adulterous fling between Emery and Allanah, it does not explicitly state that they make love, so this option is an assumption rather than a fact derived from the passages.\nOption C implies that a crazy man attacks Emery, and Allanah and Emery have dinner. Again, there is no mention of a crazy man attacking Emery nor of Emery and Allanah having dinner together in the passages.\nOption D mentions \"a crazyman\" without any context. This is too vague and not supported by the passages, which do not describe any character as a \"crazyman.\"\nOption E lists \"The police,\" which is not mentioned in the passages at all. The text does not indicate any involvement of the police in the scenario described.\n\nNone of the options provided directly match the events or descriptions given in the passages. However, if we must choose the most relevant option based on the information provided, none of them accurately reflect the content of the passages. Therefore, based on the analyses, we can conclude that none of the options are correct.\n\nThe answer is:##[]##", "The passage provides the following information about Emery Simms:\n\n- Emery Simms is described as a highly educated and successful business tycoon.\n- His life takes a negative turn after he becomes involved in an adulterous affair with Allanah, who is characterized as wildly free-spirited and exotic.\n- Emery commits a murder by killing a man who was attempting to extract information from him.\n\nBased on this information, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that are consistent with the events described in the passage. The options are:\n\nA: Crazy man enters and attacks Emery\nB: Emery and Allanah make love\nC: A crazy man attacks Emery, and Allanah and Emery have dinner\nD: A crazy man\nE: The police\n\nThe passage mentions that Emery kills a man, but it does not specify that the man was crazy or that he attacked Emery. Therefore, options A, C, and D are not supported by the text. Option B is a plausible scenario given the context of an adulterous fling but the passage does not explicitly mention them making love. Option E (The police) is not mentioned in the passage in relation to the events described.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided directly match the events as described in the passage. However, if we were to infer the closest event that aligns with an \"adulterous fling,\" it would be option B, but this is an assumption and not explicitly stated in the text. As such, based on the strict information given, none of the options are correct.\n\nThe answer is:##[]##", "The passage provides specific information about a character named Emery Simms and his actions:\n\nEmery Simms is described as a highly educated and successful business tycoon.\nHis life changes for the worse after he has an adulterous fling with Allanah, who is characterized as free-spirited and exotic.\nEmery kills a man who was attempting to extract information from him.\nThe task requires selecting the appropriate answer(s) from the options provided based on the information in the passage. The options are:\n\nA: Crazy man enters and attacks Emery\nB: Emery and Alannah makes love\nC: A crazy man attacks Emery, and Allanah and Emery have dinner\nD: A crazyman\nE: The police\n\nOption A suggests a crazy man enters and attacks Emery, which is not mentioned in the passage. The passage does not provide any information about Emery being attacked.\nOption B mentions Emery and Allanah making love, which could be inferred from the phrase \"adulterous fling,\" but it does not directly relate to the event of Emery killing a man.\nOption C combines elements of being attacked and having dinner with Allanah, but the passage does not mention either of these specific events occurring together or individually.\nOption D is incomplete and does not form a coherent statement related to the passage.\nOption E mentions the police, which is not referenced in the passage provided.\n\nBased on the passage, none of the options directly describe the events that are stated. The passage only confirms an adulterous fling and an incident where Emery kills a man. However, if we must choose the option that is closest to the information given, option B is the most related to the text, as it references the adulterous fling with Allanah.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[B]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], "predicts": [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]], "human": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}, "key": "wikiMovieSummaries/5787450.txt-3"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g3-28.txt", "qid": "3", "passage": ["Gravity is a force, but not like other forces you may know.", "Gravity is a bit special.", "You know that a force is a push or pull.", "If you push a ball, it starts to roll.", "If you lift a book, it moves upward.", "Now, imagine you drop a ball.", "It falls to the ground.", "Can you see the force pulling it down?", "That is what makes gravity really cool.", "It is invisible.", "Invisible means you cannot see it.", "But wait, it has even more surprises.", "Gravity holds planets in place around the Sun.", "Gravity keeps the Moon from flying off into space.", "Gravity exerts a force on objects that are not even touching.", "In fact, gravity can act over very large distances.", "However, the force does get weaker the farther apart the objects are."], "question": {"question": "How is gravity a special force?", "sentences_used": [0, 9, 1, 7], "answers": [{"text": "It is always a push", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "It keeps planets orbiting around the sun and the moon from flying into space", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "It is a push or pull", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "It moves things", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "It is a pull", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Gravity is an invisible force that pulls down", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "It causes things to fall", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "It is is invisible", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "It is invisible and you can't see it", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "It pushes and pulls objects", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "3", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.75, 0.25], "real_label": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "single_answer": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nGravity is a force, but not like other forces you may know.\nIt is invisible.\nGravity is a bit special.\nCan you see the force pulling it down?\n\n[Options:]\nA: It is always a push\nB: It keeps planets orbiting around the sun and the moon from flying into space\nC: It is a push or pull\nD: It moves things\nE: It is a pull\nF: Gravity is an invisible force that pulls down\nG: It causes things to fall\nH: It is is invisible\nI: It is invisible and you can't see it\nJ: It pushes and pulls objects\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

While Sanjay's sweetheart, Kalpana, is mentioned, it is her death that motivates his actions, not the fact that they are lovers.\nOption B suggests that Ghajini accepted money from the police department to murder Sanjay. This is not mentioned in the passage, so we cannot assume this to be true.\nOption C states that Sanjay is seeking revenge for the death of Kalpana. This aligns with the information given in the passage and is a correct reason for Sanjay's actions.\nOption D mentions the government, which is not referenced in the passage in any context related to Sanjay's motivations or actions.\nOption E suggests that Sanjay is probably related to the murder of Kalpana. The passage does indicate that Sanjay's actions are related to Kalpana's murder since he is avenging her death, but it does not explicitly state that he is related to the murder itself.\nBased on the passage, the most accurate answer is that Sanjay is seeking revenge for the death of his sweetheart, Kalpana, which corresponds with option C.

One of the things it depends on is the object's mass.\n\nGiven this information, we can evaluate the options provided:\n\nA: This option is directly contradicted by the passage, which states that the object's mass is one of the factors affecting how much its motion changes when a force is applied.\nB: This option is simply the word \"No,\" which does not provide a clear statement related to the passage's content.\nC: This option suggests that motion changes only depend on the strength of the force applied. However, the passage indicates that there is another factor involved, which is the object's mass.\nD: This option is the word \"Yes,\" which could be interpreted as an agreement with the passage's statement that the object's mass is a factor in how its motion changes when a force is applied.\n\nBased on the passage, we can conclude that the object's mass is indeed a factor in how much its motion changes when a force is applied. Therefore, option A is incorrect, option C is incorrect as it ignores the role of mass, and option B is not relevant. Option D, while not providing a full statement, can be seen as an agreement with the passage's claim about the importance of mass.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "The passage discusses the factors that affect the change in motion of an object when a force is applied. It makes two points:\n\n1. The change in an object's motion when a force is applied depends on two things.\n2. One of those things is the object's mass.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the object's mass is indeed a factor in how much its motion changes when a force is applied. This directly contradicts option A, which states that the object's mass has very little to do with the change in motion, and option C, which claims that motion changes only depend on the strength of the force applied.\n\nOption B (No) does not provide a clear context or statement that can be evaluated as true or false based on the passage.\n\nOption D (Yes) agrees with the passage in that it implies affirmation, which in the context of the options provided, can be interpreted as agreeing that the object's mass does indeed affect how its motion changes when a force is applied.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "To answer this reading comprehension question, let's break down the information provided in the passage:\n\nThe passage states that the change in an object's motion when a force is applied depends on two things.\nIt specifically mentions that one of these things is the object's mass.\nWith this understanding, we can evaluate the given options:\n\nOption A states that the change in an object's motion when a force is applied has very little to do with the object's mass. This statement contradicts the passage, which clearly states that the object's mass is one of the factors that influence the change in motion.\nOption B simply says \"No,\" which is not a complete statement and does not provide enough information to be evaluated against the passage.\nOption C suggests that motion changes only depend on the strength of the force applied. This statement is incorrect because the passage indicates that the object's mass is also a factor, not just the strength of the force.\nOption D says \"Yes,\" which seems to affirm the statement made in the passage but lacks context since it is not clear what it is affirming.\nGiven that the passage emphasizes the importance of the object's mass in determining how much its motion changes when a force is applied, and none of the options directly affirm this fact with sufficient clarity, the most appropriate answer based on the passage is that none of the given options are correct.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##", "The passage discusses the factors that affect the change in an object's motion when a force is applied.

The options given are: A (Holy Roman Emperor), B (Ferdinand), C (Isabella), D (Charles V), and E (Charles I).\n\nThe passage does not directly mention the name of the monarch, but we can infer from historical context. The revolt of the comuneros is a well-known historical event that took place during the reign of Charles V, who was also known as Charles I of Spain. Thus, options D (Charles V) and E (Charles I) refer to the same historical figure, who was the monarch at the time of the comuneros' revolt.\n\nOptions A (Holy Roman Emperor), B (Ferdinand), and C (Isabella) are not directly related to the passage, although Charles V was also Holy Roman Emperor. However, the passage specifically refers to the revolt in Spanish cities, so we should select the names by which he was known in the context of Spain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on historical context and the information provided in the passage, are: The answer is:##[DE]##", "To determine the correct answer(s), we must analyze the passage and identify the monarch referred to in the context of a historical event.

This revolt is a well-documented event in Spanish history, and Charles V was indeed the Holy Roman Emperor at the time, which makes option A correct as well. Options B (Ferdinand) and C (Isabella) refer to other members of Spanish royalty who were not reigning during the comuneros revolt.\n\nBased on the historical context, the correct answers are Charles V and Charles I, who are the same person but known by different titles. Holy Roman Emperor also refers to Charles V.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AD]##", "To determine the correct answer(s) from the options provided, we must analyze the passage for clues about the identity of the monarch mentioned.\n\nThe passage states that:\n- The monarch was away on business trips.\n- During his absence, his subjects protested violently.\n- A revolt of the comuneros occurred in Spanish cities, including Madrid.\n\nThe passage does not directly name the monarch, so we must use historical context to infer the correct answer. The revolt of the comuneros is a historical event known as the Revolt of the Comuneros, which took place in Spain during the reign of Charles V, who was also known as Charles I of Spain. This revolt occurred in the early 16th century and was a major event in Spanish history.\n\nGiven this historical context, we can conclude that the monarch referred to in the passage is Charles V, who is also Charles I of Spain. Therefore, the correct answers are D (Charles V) and E (Charles I), as they refer to the same person.\n\nThe answer is:##[DE]##", "The passage discusses a historical event involving a monarch and his subjects.

Charles V was indeed the Holy Roman Emperor as well, which makes option A correct too. However, Ferdinand and Isabella were his grandparents and reigned over Spain prior to Charles V, so they are not the correct answers in this context.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical context of the revolt of the comuneros, the correct answers are the titles associated with the monarch in question during the time of the revolt:\n\nThe answer is:##[AD]##", "To determine the correct answer(s), we need to analyze the passage for clues about the identity of the monarch mentioned:\n\nThe passage refers to a monarch who was away on business trips, during which time his subjects protested violently.\nThe revolt mentioned is that of the comuneros, which is a historical reference to a revolt that occurred in Spanish cities, including Madrid.\nWhile the passage does not directly name the monarch, the reference to the revolt of the comuneros provides a significant historical clue. The Revolt of the Comuneros (1519-1521) was a major uprising against the rule of Charles V, who was also known as Charles I in Spain. Charles V was a Holy Roman Emperor, which further confirms his identity in relation to the passage.\n\nOptions B (Ferdinand) and C (Isabella) refer to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, who were the Catholic Monarchs of Spain prior to Charles V. Since the passage is about a revolt that occurred during the time of Charles V, these options are incorrect.\n\nOption A (Holy Roman Emperor) is a title that was held by Charles V, but without a specific name, it does not directly answer the question about the monarch's identity.\n\nOption D (Charles V) and option E (Charles I) both refer to the same person, Charles V, who was known as Charles I in Spain.

The options are: A (To a cave), B (In the lake), and C (In the door).\n\nThe passage specifically mentions that Tibo is taken to the mouth of a cave, which directly corresponds with option A. There is no mention of a lake, so option B is not relevant.

The option mentioning a lake (B) is not relevant to the passage, as there is no mention of a lake in the provided text. Similarly, option C (In the door) is not a logical answer because \"in the door\" does not make sense in this context; the door is an object that was removed to allow entrance to the cave, not a location where Tibo could be pushed into.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the passage, is: The answer is:##[A]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 0], "predicts": [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]], "human": [1, 0, 1]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg_withoutQuotes/gutenberg-106-0.txt-10"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g4-142.txt", "qid": "1", "passage": ["You have seen your own reflection in a mirror.", "The person looking back at you looks just like you.", "Where does that reflected person appear to be standing?", "Yes, they appear to be on the other side of the mirror.", "That is really strange to think about, but very cool.", "Have you ever waved at your reflection in a mirror?", "The reflected image will wave back at you.", "Here is something to try next time you stand in front of a mirror.", "Wave to your reflection with your right hand.", "What hand do you think the reflection will wave back with?", "The same hand?", "A different hand?", "You will notice something interesting.", "The reflection waves back with the hand on the same side as you, but it is their left hand.", "The image in a reflection is reversed.", "This is just like the image of the sign above.", "Light rays strike flat shiny surfaces and are reflected.", "The reflections are reversed."], "question": {"question": "How does reflection work?", "sentences_used": [16, 17], "answers": [{"text": "Light rays strike flat shiny surfaces and are reflected and the reflections are reversed", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The image in a reflection comes from the lights", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The image in a reflection is reversed", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "1", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0.75, 0.75, 0.5], "real_label": [1, 0, 1], "single_answer": [1, 1, 1], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nLight rays strike flat shiny surfaces and are reflected.\nThe reflections are reversed.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Light rays strike flat shiny surfaces and are reflected and the reflections are reversed\nB: The image in a reflection comes from the lights\nC: The image in a reflection is reversed\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The passage does talk about higher rates, but there is no mention of being better with money, so the second part of this option is not supported by the passage.\nOption G (Higher rates, higher funding) is not supported by the passage.

This corresponds to option B.\n- The passage also indicates that the location affects the fees charged, with higher fees being charged in the Salt Lake area compared to the Ogden area.

This indicates that the location can affect the hourly rate that lawyers can charge, which in turn affects their earnings.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, we can deduce the following:\n- Having a lot of clients (full waiting rooms and booked appointments) is a sign of a potentially lucrative law practice, which aligns with option B (Lots of clients and a high attorney hourly fee) and

The options are: A (149 b.c.), B (After 250 b.c.), C (250 B.C.), D (200 B.C.), and E (By 250 b.c.).\n\nThe passage specifies \"by 250 b.c.\" which is directly reflected in option E. Option C (250 B.C.) also represents the same year, albeit in uppercase letters. However, the other options (A, B, and D) refer to different time periods that are not mentioned or implied in the passage.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given in the passage, the correct answers that align with the specified time by which the city's population had grown to 100,000 are options C and E.\n\nThe answer is:##[CE]##", "To determine the correct answer(s) from the options provided, let's analyze the passage:\n\nThe passage states a historical fact about the population of a city by a specific time.\nIt indicates that by the year \"250 b.c.\", the city's population had reached 100,000.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe passage is referring to a point in time which is \"250 b.c.\" or before, which corresponds to option C and E.\nOptions A (149 b.c.) and D (200 B.C) refer to times after 250 b.c., which are not supported by the passage since it specifically mentions \"by 250 b.c.\"\nOption B (After 250 b.c.) is also incorrect because the passage indicates the population size was already achieved by 250 b.c., not after.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with the time frame provided is C and E.\nSo, The answer is:##[CE]##", "The passage provides a specific historical reference point related to the population of a city:\n\nIt states that by 250 B.C., the city's population had reached 100,000.\nThe use of \"by\" indicates that the population figure is given as of that date or earlier, not after.\nGiven the context, we must select the option(s) that accurately reflect this historical reference point. The options provided are specific years or timeframes: A (149 B.C.), B (After 250 B.C.), C (250 B.C.), D (200 B.C.), and E (By 250 B.C.).\n\nOption A (149 B.C.) is a date that occurs after 250 B.C., so it does not match the reference point of \"by 250 B.C.\" \nOption B (After 250 B.C.) explicitly states a time after the given date, which again does not align with the information provided.\nOption C (250 B.C.) refers to the exact year mentioned in the passage but does not include the preposition \"by,\" which indicates the population figure was reached by that time or earlier.\nOption D (200 B.C.) is a date that occurs after 250 B.C., so it is also not a match.\nOption E (By 250 B.C.) directly matches the phrasing in the passage and correctly indicates the population figure as of 250 B.C. or earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided in the passage, is: The answer is:##[E]##", "To determine the correct answer(s) from the given options, we need to closely examine the information provided in the passage:\n\nThe passage states a historical fact about the city's population size by a specific time, which is \"by 250 b.c.\"\nThe use of \"by\" indicates that the population reached 100,000 at or before the year 250 B.C.\nThe options are specific years or timeframes: A (149 b.c.), B (After 250 b.c.), C (250 B.C.), D (200 B.C.), and E (By 250 b.c.).\n\nOption A (149 b.c.) suggests a time after 250 B.C., which does not align with the phrase \"by 250 b.c.\" since the population size mentioned is already reached by that year.\nOption B (After 250 b.c.) also indicates a timeframe that is after the year mentioned in the passage, which does not match the information given.\nOption C (250 B.C.) is a specific year, which is in line with the passage as the population size could have been reached exactly in that year.\nOption D (200 B.C.) is a year before 250 B.C., which could also be included in the timeframe \"by 250 b.c.\" as the population could have reached 100,000 before that year.\nOption E (By 250 b.c.) directly matches the phrasing in the passage and accurately represents the timeframe by which the population size was reached.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answers are the ones that fit the timeframe \"by 250 b.c.,\" which includes the year 250 B.C. itself and any time before it.\n\nTherefore, The answer

Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage.

Options A (When he finished searching the ground floor) and D (When he finished searching the cellar) are specific actions the narrator took but do not indicate the time of day. Options B (Bedtime), C (Midnight), and I (Around noon) are clearly incorrect as they do not match the description of the time of day in the passage.

This aligns with option A (When he finished searching the ground floor).\nThe narrator considers extinguishing the candle after completing the ground floor search, which further supports option A.\nThe narrator decides to have another look around the cellars, but the passage does not specify that the candle was extinguished after the cellar search, so option D (When he finished searching the cellar) is not directly supported by the text.\nOptions B (Bedtime), C (Midnight), F (When he entered the cellar), and I (Around noon) are not supported by the information given in the passage.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answers related to the time when the narrator was on the point of extinguishing the candle are A, E, G, and H, as they are all indicative of the early morning time frame described.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[AEGH]##", "The passage describes a sequence of events that occur during the early hours of the morning:\n\n- The narrator mentions leaving the tower at daybreak, indicating it was the beginning of the day (\"The day was just breaking\").\n- It was still too dark inside the house to see without a light, so the narrator took a study candle for illumination.\n- By the time the narrator finished inspecting the ground floor, daylight was \"creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows,\" suggesting that it was still early morning.\n- The narrator contemplates extinguishing the candle after verifying that everything on the ground floor was in order, which indicates that there was enough natural light to see without artificial light.\n- The narrator decides to have another look around the cellars, which implies that the action is still ongoing during the early morning hours.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine the following:\n\n- The narrator left the tower at break of dawn (E) and just as the day was breaking (G).\n- The narrator finished searching the ground floor as daylight was creeping in, which corresponds to early morning (H).\n- The narrator contemplated extinguishing the candle after finishing the ground floor search, which also indicates early morning (H).\n\nOptions B (Bedtime), C (Midnight), D (When he finished searching the cellar), F (When he entered the cellar), and I (Around noon) are not supported by the information in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers based

finished the ground floor, daylight is described as \"creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows,\" which suggests that it is still early in the morning, but light is beginning to increase.\n- The narrator contemplates extinguishing the candle, indicating that there is enough natural light to consider doing so.\n- The phrase \"the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars\" implies that the narrator is still in the process of inspecting the house, and this decision is made after the ground floor is finished but before the cellars are checked.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The narrator leaves the tower at break of dawn (E) and just as the day was breaking (G), which are synonymous descriptions.\n- The term \"early morning\" (H) is a general description of the time period covered by the narrative.\n- The option \"When he finished searching the ground floor\" (A) corresponds to the point in the narrative when the narrator

The passage provides specific information about the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI):\n\n- The DCI is confirmed by the Senate.\n- The DCI is not technically a member of the president's cabinet.\n- The director's power over the \"intelligence community\" is described as limited under federal law.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The DCI's confirmation comes from the Senate, which corresponds to options F and G.\n- The power of the DCI is limited, which is explicitly stated in the passage and corresponds to options A and J.\n- The passage does not suggest that the DCI has broad powers, so options C and K are incorrect.\n- The DCI is not confirmed by Congress in general, but specifically by the Senate, so option E is incorrect.\n- The DCI is not confirmed by the President, so option H is incorrect.\n- The passage does not mention \"The People\" or \"All Power,\" so options B and D are irrelevant.\n- Option I summarizes the situation accurately, stating that the DCI is confirmed by the Senate and has limited power.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the confirmation by the Senate and the limited power of the DCI are F, G, and I. However, since option I is a more comprehensive statement that includes both the confirmation by the Senate and the limited power, it is the best choice among the three.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[I]##", "The passage provides specific details regarding the role and confirmation of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI):\n\n- The DCI is confirmed by the Senate.\n- The DCI is not technically a member of the president's cabinet.\n- The director's power over the intelligence community is described as limited under federal law.\n\nBased on these points, we can evaluate the options provided:\n\nA: \"President of the United States, limited\" is partially correct because it mentions \"limited,\" but the passage does not discuss the President's role in the confirmation process.\nB: \"The People\" is not mentioned in the passage.\nC: \"Senate, broad\" is incorrect because the passage specifies the power is limited, not broad.\nD: \"All Power\" is incorrect because the passage clearly states the power is limited.\nE: \"Confirmed by Congress with a lot of power\" is incorrect because it is the Senate that confirms the DCI, and the power is not described as \"a lot,\" but as limited.\nF: \"Confirmed by the Senate with limited power\" is correct as it aligns with the information in the passage.\nG: \"The DCI is confirmed by the senate\" is correct.\nH: \"DCI is confirmed by the president\" is incorrect because the passage states the Senate confirms the DCI.\nI: \"Even though the DCI is not a cabinet member he or she is confirmed by the senate and has limited power\" is correct as it encapsulates the main points from the passage.\nJ: \"Senate, limited\" is partially correct; it correctly identifies the Senate's role in confirmation and the limited power, but it does not specify what is limited.\nK: \"President of the United States, broad\" is incorrect for the same reason as A and also because the passage does not mention the President having broad powers in this context.\n\nGiven the information in the passage, the correct answers are those that align with the Senate's confirmation of the DCI and the limited power of the director.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[FGI]##", "The passage provides information about the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and their relationship with other branches of the U.S. government:\n\n- The DCI is confirmed by the Senate, which aligns with options F and G.\n- The DCI is not technically a member of the president's cabinet, which eliminates any options that suggest the DCI is confirmed by the president or is a cabinet member (H).\n- The director's power over the intelligence community is described as limited under federal law, which is consistent with options A, F, I, and J.\n\nOptions B (The People) and D (All Power) are irrelevant to the context provided. Option C (Senate, broad) is incorrect because the passage specifies the power is limited, not broad. Option E (Confirmed by Congress with a lot of power) is incorrect because the confirmation is by the Senate specifically, not Congress as a whole, and the power is limited, not a lot. Option K (President of the United States, broad) is incorrect because the DCI's power is not broad and is not confirmed by the President.\n\nThe options that correctly reflect the information in the passage are F (Confirmed by the Senate with limited power), G (The DCI is confirmed by the senate), and I (Even though the DCI is not a cabinet member, he or she is confirmed by the senate and has limited power).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[FGI]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}, "key": "Sept11-reports/oanc-chapter-3-2.txt-20"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "wikiMovieSummaries-18640799.txt", "qid": "2", "passage": ["The film opens with Sunita , a medical student , and her friends working on a project about the human brain .", "She wants to investigate the curious case of Sanjay Singhania , a notable city businessman , who is reported to have anterograde amnesia .", "Her professor denies access to Sanjay's records as it is currently under criminal investigation .", "Sunita , nonetheless , decides to investigate the matter herself .", "Sanjay is introduced as he brutally murders a man .", "He takes a Polaroid picture of the man , and writes on it `` done '' .", "It is revealed that Sanjay has anterograde amnesia where he loses his memory every 15 minutes .", "Sanjay uses a system of photographs , notes , and tattoos on his body to recover his memory after each cycle .", "It is revealed that Sanjay is ultimately out to avenge the death of his sweetheart Kalpana , and that he is systematically killing the people who were responsible for it .", "His main target is `` Ghajini '' , a notable social personality in the city .", "Police Inspector Arjun Yadav , on the case of the serial murders , tracks Sanjay down to his flat and attacks and disables him .", "Yadav finds two diaries where Sanjay has chronicled the events of 2005 and 2006 .", "The film flashes back to 2005 as Yadav reads the diary .", "Sanjay Singhania is shown as the owner of the Air Voice mobile telephone company .", "In the course of his business , Sanjay sends his men to meet Kalpana , a struggling model , about putting up a billboard above her apartment .", "The owner of Kalpana's advertising firm misinterprets this as a romantic advance , and in view of a possible lucrative Air Voice ad campaign and other benefits , encourages Kalpana to accept the overture ."], "question": {"question": "Why did Sanjay murdered a man?", "sentences_used": [4, 8], "answers": [{"text": "Sanjay", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because he needed money", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because he's sick", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Sanjay is avenging the murder of his sweetheart, Kalpana", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because he's taking revenge of his lover", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "2", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0], "real_label": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], "single_answer": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nSanjay is introduced as he brutally murders a man .\nIt is revealed that Sanjay is ultimately out to avenge the death of his sweetheart Kalpana , and that he is systematically killing the people who were responsible for it .\n\n[Options:]\nA: Sanjay\nB: Because he needed money\nC: Because he's sick\nD: Sanjay is avenging the murder of his sweetheart, Kalpana\nE: Because he's taking revenge of his lover\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage.

The motive is also stated in a slightly different wording in option E (Because he's taking revenge of his lover), which is synonymous with the motive described in the passage. Options B (Because he needed money) and C (Because he's sick) are not mentioned in the passage and do not align with the provided information about his motive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are A (Sanjay), D (Sanjay is avenging the murder of his sweetheart, Kalpana), and E (Because he's taking revenge of his lover). However, since D and E essentially convey the same reason, we would typically choose the option that is most directly supported by the text, which in this case is D.

While option H might seem similar to option C, \"the night of the attack\" is not the same as \"the evening of the attack\" and is not explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are: The answer is:##[CF]##", "The passage provides information about the narrator's actions and experiences regarding a visit to the cellars:\n\nThe narrator was about to extinguish a candle but decided to have another look around the cellars.\nThe narrator notes that they had not been to the cellars since a specific time, which they recall as \"my hasty search on the evening of the attack.\"\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n\nOption A (That morning) is not mentioned as the time of the last visit to the cellars.\nOption B (A week ago) is not specified as the time frame for the last visit.\nOption C (The evening of the attack) is explicitly mentioned as the time of the last visit.\nOption D (Early in the morning) is not mentioned as the time of the last visit.\nOption E (He'd never been there) is incorrect because the narrator clearly states they had been there before.\nOption F (The last time he went there was on the evening of the attack) is a correct restatement of the information provided in the passage.\nOption G (Just before searching the ground floor) is not mentioned or implied in the passage.\nOption H (The night of the attack) is essentially the same event as \"the evening of the attack,\" so it could also be considered correct.\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the last time the narrator visited the cellars are C, F, and potentially H (as it refers to the same time as C but with different wording).\n\nSo, The answer is:##[CFH]##", "The passage describes a person's actions and thoughts concerning a visit to the cellars. The key information to extract from the passage is as follows:\n\n- The individual was about to extinguish their candle, indicating that they were done with whatever they were doing.\n- They decided to have one more look around the cellars.\n- The individual recalls that they had not been into the cellars since a specific time, which is described as \"my hasty search on the evening of the attack.\"\n\nBased on this information, we can determine the following:\n\nOption C (The evening of the attack) corresponds with the time the individual last remembers being in the cellars.\nOption F (The last time he went there was on the evening of the attack) is another way to state the same fact mentioned in the passage.\nThe other options are either not mentioned in the passage or do not accurately reflect the information given:\nA (That morning), B (A week ago), D (Early in the morning), and G (Just before searching the ground floor) are not referenced as times when the individual visited the cellars.\nE (He'd never been there) is incorrect because the passage clearly states the individual had been there on the evening of the attack.\nH (The night of the attack) is essentially the same event as \"the evening of the attack,\" but since the passage specifically uses the word \"evening,\" we will prioritize that wording.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the last time the individual was in the cellars are C and F.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[CF]##", "To answer this question, let's analyze the provided passage for details regarding the timing of the events:\n\n- The narrator was about to extinguish their candle, which indicates it was likely nighttime or they were in a dark place.\n- The narrator decides to have another look around the cellars.\n- The narrator states they had not been into the cellars since the evening of the attack, as per their recollection.\n\nGiven these points, we can determine that the last time the narrator had been to the cellars was on the evening of the attack. This information directly corresponds with options C (The evening of the attack) and F (The last time he went there was on the evening of the attack). Other options, such as that morning (A), a week ago (B), early in the morning (D), he'd never been there (E), just before searching the ground floor (G), and the night of the attack (H), are not supported by the information in the passage.\n\nIt is important to note that options C (The evening of the attack) and H (The night of the attack) might seem similar, but the passage specifically mentions \"the evening of the attack\" which is a more precise timeframe than \"the night of the attack,\" which could imply any time during the night.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage, the correct answers are options C and F, as they both accurately describe the last time the narrator had been in the cellars.\n\nThe answer is:##[CF]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg-10002.txt-13"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction-stories-masc-hotel-California-0.txt", "qid": "1", "passage": ["Hotel California Fact: Sound is a vibration.", "Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium.", "So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing.", "After the first whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder.", "Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams.", "Quiet and peaceful, right?", "Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave.", "I swore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey.", "Metaphorically, of course.", "Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live.", "This is more than the person would have sans space suit.", "Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has followed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up; yes, studies have been done.", "So, twenty-four hours.", "Give or take.", "About the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like, that's when I heard a bell."], "question": {"question": "Was the air really sucked out of the shuttle?", "sentences_used": [14, 1, 2], "answers": [{"text": "No, it was sucked away from the narrator's space suit", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Yes, because the shuttle malfunctioned", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "No, there was just a lighting and a thunder", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "No, because the narrator heard a bell at the end", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "1", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 1, 0, 0], "real_label": [0, 1, 0, 1], "single_answer": [0, 1, 0, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nAbout the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like, that's when I heard a bell.\nSound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium.\nSo when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing.\n\n[Options:]\nA: No, it was sucked away from the narrator's space suit\nB: Yes, because the shuttle malfunctioned\nC: No, there was just a lighting and a thunder\nD: No, because the narrator heard a bell at the end\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

This is incorrect because, despite the shuttle malfunction, the narrator explicitly states they heard nothing due to the lack of a medium in space.\nOption C is irrelevant as it introduces elements (lightning and thunder) not mentioned in the passage.\nOption D is incorrect because the narrator heard a bell before the airlocks failed, not at the end. The passage clearly states that when the airlocks failed, the narrator heard nothing.\nThe correct answer must address the fact that the narrator did not hear anything due to the shuttle malfunction and the absence of a medium in space for sound to travel. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is:##[A]##", "The passage provides a narrative about an individual's experience in space and gives information about sound travel:\n\nThe narrator was composing their last words and trying not to think about suffocation, indicating a life-threatening situation.\nThe narrator mentions hearing a bell, which is crucial to understanding the context.\nIt is stated that sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium and that in space, there is no medium.\nThe narrator's shuttle malfunctioned, and the airlocks failed to keep the air in, but despite the malfunction, the narrator mentions hearing nothing.\nThe task is to determine whether the narrator heard a bell or not, based on the options provided.\n\nOption A (No, it was sucked away from the narrator's space suit) does not directly relate to hearing a bell but rather suggests a reason why sound might not be heard, which is consistent with the passage's explanation about the lack of medium for sound in space.\n\nOption B (Yes, because the shuttle malfunctioned) is incorrect because, despite the shuttle malfunction, the absence of a medium in space would prevent sound from traveling, as explained in the passage.\n\nOption C (No, there was just a lighting and a thunder) is not relevant to the context of the passage, as there is no mention of lightning or thunder.\n\nOption D (No, because the narrator heard a bell at the end) is contradictory. The narrator initially mentions hearing a bell, but then clarifies that when the shuttle malfunctioned and the air was lost, they heard nothing, which implies that the mention of hearing a bell was either metaphorical or part of the narrator's thoughts rather than an actual sound.\n\nBased on the analyses, the correct answer is that the narrator did not hear a bell because in space, there is no medium for sound to travel, and the shuttle malfunction led to a loss of air, which would prevent sound from being heard. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is:##[A]##", "The passage provides a narrative about an individual's experience in space and includes details about sound transmission:\n\nThe narrator was composing their last words and trying not to think about suffocation, indicating a life-threatening situation.\nThe narrator heard a bell, which is a crucial detail.\nIt is explained that sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium.\nThe narrator's shuttle malfunctioned, and the airlocks failed to keep the air in, which would imply that sound could not travel as it normally would on Earth.\nThe options provided are:\n\nA: No, it was sucked away from the narrator's space suit\nB: Yes, because the shuttle malfunctioned\nC: No, there was just a lighting and a thunder\nD: No, because the narrator heard a bell at the end\n\nBased on the passage, option B is incorrect because although the shuttle malfunctioned, the lack of a medium in space means that sound cannot travel, so the narrator should not have been able to hear anything. Option C is incorrect because the passage does not mention lightning or thunder. Option D seems to contradict the information about sound not traveling in space, but it's important to recognize that the narrator did hear a bell, which is a sound. This indicates that there must have been some air remaining in the shuttle or the narrator's suit, allowing the sound to travel, despite the malfunctioning airlocks. Option A suggests that the air (and thus the medium for sound) was sucked away from the narrator's space suit, but this is not directly supported by the passage.\n\nThe correct answer is based on the detail that the narrator heard a bell, which indicates that sound was indeed heard, despite the expected lack of a medium in space. This could suggest an inconsistency or an error in the narrator's perception or an unexplained presence of a medium that allowed sound to travel. The passage does not provide enough information to conclusively explain how the sound was heard, but it does clearly state that the narrator heard a bell.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[D]##", "To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze the passage and the context in which the information is presented:\n\n1. The narrator is in a situation where they are contemplating their last moments, specifically thinking about what suffocating feels like.\n2.

The passage explains that sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium and that in space, there is no medium.\n4. The narrator's shuttle has malfunctioned, and the airlocks failed to keep the air in, which would imply that the narrator is in a vacuum where sound cannot travel.\n5. The final statement, \"I heard nothing,\" contradicts the earlier statement of hearing a bell.\n\nBased on the information provided:\n\n- Option A suggests that the air was sucked away from the narrator's space suit, which is consistent with the malfunction described but does not directly answer whether the narrator heard a bell.\n- Option B is incorrect because, despite the shuttle malfunctioning, the narrator explicitly states that they heard nothing due to the lack of a medium for sound to travel in space.\n- Option C introduces elements (lightning and thunder) that are not mentioned in the passage at all.\n- Option D seems to be the correct choice because it directly addresses the contradiction in the passage: the narrator couldn't have heard a bell because there is no medium for sound in space, yet they mention hearing a bell, which creates a paradox.\n\nGiven the details in the passage and the final statement made by the narrator, the correct answer is that the narrator did not actually hear a bell because sound cannot travel in the vacuum of space. The mention of hearing a bell is likely a metaphorical or psychological experience rather than a physical one.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "The passage provides a narrative about the experiences of the narrator during a critical moment in space:\n\nThe narrator was composing their last thoughts, which suggests they were in a dire situation.\nThey reflect on the nature of sound, stating that it travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium.\nThe narrator mentions a shuttle malfunction where the airlocks failed to retain air, and as a result, they heard nothing.\nThe options given seem to pertain to whether the narrator could hear sounds in space after the shuttle malfunctioned.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, we can deduce the following:\n\nOption A suggests that air was sucked away from the narrator's space suit, which is consistent with the shuttle malfunction and the airlocks not keeping the air in. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state that the air was sucked away from the narrator's space suit.\nOption B implies that the narrator could hear because the shuttle malfunctioned. This contradicts the information in the passage, which clearly states that the narrator heard nothing due to the lack of a medium for sound to travel through in space.\nOption C introduces an unrelated scenario involving lightning and thunder, which is not mentioned in the passage and is irrelevant to the context.\nOption D is a tricky option because it mentions the narrator hearing a bell at the end. The passage does talk about hearing a bell, but this is likely a metaphorical or imagined bell, as the narrator immediately follows this statement with the explanation that sound cannot travel in space due to the absence of a medium.\nGiven the context that the narrator heard nothing due to the shuttle malfunction and the nature of sound travel in space, the correct answer is that the narrator did not hear any sound after the shuttle malfunctioned.

The sequence of actions suggests that the touching of the sleeve was followed by the announcement that \"The judge is coming,\" which implies that the touch was a signal or a cue related to this announcement. Furthermore, Mr. Thorndike's subsequent action of sitting down suggests that he understood the touch as a cue for something significant, likely the judge's arrival.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely reason for touching the sleeve was to signal or communicate that the judge was coming.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "To determine the correct answer(s) from the given options, we need to closely examine the actions and context provided in the passage:\n\nThe passage states that \"He arose, and touched his sleeve.\" This action of touching his sleeve is not fully explained, but it is followed by a statement indicating a new development: \"The judge is coming.\"\nThe passage then mentions, \"Mr. Thorndike sat down.\" This suggests that Mr. Thorndike's action of sitting down is a response to the information that the judge is coming.\nThe options given are: A (To dust it off), B (To pull him closer), C (To get his attention), and D (To tell him the judge was coming).\nOption A (To dust it off) could be a plausible reason for touching one's sleeve, but there is no context in the passage to suggest that the action was performed for this purpose.\nOption B (To pull him closer) doesn't fit the context as there is no indication that there is another person involved who is being pulled closer.\nOption C (To get his attention) could be a reasonable interpretation since touching someone's sleeve is often a gesture to get their attention, but the passage does not specify whose attention is being sought or if this is indeed the purpose.\nOption D (To tell him the judge was coming) is directly supported by the sequence of events in the passage. The action of touching his sleeve is immediately followed by the announcement of the judge's arrival, suggesting that the touch could be a signal to convey this message.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most supported answer is that the action of touching the sleeve was related to informing Mr. Thorndike that the judge was coming.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[D]##", "The passage provides a sequence of actions but does not explicitly state the reason for the first action. Here's the sequence:\n\n1. \"He arose\" - someone stood up.\n2. \"and touched his sleeve\" - the person who stood up touched someone else's sleeve.\n3. \"The judge is coming.\" - a statement is made about the judge's arrival.\n4. \"Mr. Thorndike sat down.\" - Mr. Thorndike responds by sitting down.\n\nThe passage does not clarify why \"he\" touched the sleeve. The options given are various interpretations of that action:\n\nA: To dust it off - There is no indication in the passage that the sleeve was dusty or needed cleaning.\nB: To pull him closer - The passage does not suggest any physical movement or repositioning of the person whose sleeve was touched.\nC: To get his attention - This is a plausible interpretation because touching someone's sleeve is often a way to gently get their attention.\nD: To tell him the judge was coming - This option is directly supported by the passage. The sequence of actions suggests that the touch on the sleeve was a precursor to the verbal announcement about the judge's arrival.\n\nBased on the passage, the most logical conclusion is that the sleeve was touched to signal the announcement of the judge's arrival.

Initially, the rate for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation was $25 an hour. However, as of last week, he has increased this rate to a minimum of $50 an hour.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe new rate is $50 an hour, which corresponds to option A.\nThe old rate was $25 an hour, which is mentioned in option D.\nOptions B ($400) and C ($150) are not mentioned anywhere in the passage and are therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the raised rates and the original rates are A and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##\n\n\nSample2:\n[Passages:]\nLucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird.\nShe draws a picture of her family.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Martha\nB: Lucy\n\n[Analyses:]\nAnalyzing the provided passages gives us key information about the central figure in the narrative:\n\nLucy is identified as an eight-year-old girl.\nIt's stated that Lucy lives with her parents and a pet bird.\nLucy engages in an activity where she draws a picture of her family.\nGiven this context, the task requires selecting appropriate answers from the options A (Martha) and B (Lucy). Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage.
