The passage is discussing the Roman Empire's control over the Italian peninsula and the network of roads that connected it to Rome.\nNext, we need to identify the key information in the passage. The passage mentions the names of the roads - Via Appia, Flaminia, and Aurelia - and their significance in connecting the peninsula to Rome.\nNow, let's examine the options. Option A mentions the regions that were conquered by the Romans, but it does not directly relate to the network of roads mentioned in the passage. Option B mentions the founders of Rome, but it is not relevant to the topic of the passage. Option C mentions the names of cities, but it does not match the names of the roads mentioned in the passage. Option D mentions the cultural influences on the Roman Empire, but it is not directly related to the topic of the passage.

This means that the location of the practice can affect the hourly fee.\nBased on this information, we can conclude that having a high number of clients and a high attorney hourly fee is the most important factor for a lucrative law practice.\nTherefore, the answer is: B.\n#### 250\nThe answer is: 250", "\nThe answer is:", "\n#### 100\nThe answer is: 100", "\nThe passage mentions that for most lawyers, a full waiting room and appointments booked out to mid-July would equate to a lucrative law practice.\nIt also states that fees range in the $150 to $250 an hour range in the Ogden area, and up to $400 an hour in the Salt Lake area.\nTo determine the best answer, we need to consider the factors that contribute to a lucrative law practice.\n\nOption A: Higher fees - This option aligns with the information provided in the passage. If a lawyer charges higher fees, it can contribute to a lucrative law practice.\nOption B: Lots of clients and a high attorney hourly fee - This option also aligns with the information provided in the passage. If a lawyer has a high attorney hourly fee and lots of clients, it can contribute to a lucrative law practice.\nOption C: Location - The location is not mentioned as a factor in the passage. Therefore, this option is not relevant.\nOption D: Grant money - Grant money is not mentioned as a factor in the passage. Therefore, this option is not relevant.\nOption E: More Clients - This option aligns with the information provided in the passage. If a lawyer has more clients, it can contribute to a lucrative law practice.\nOption F: Higher rates and being better with money - This option aligns with the information provided in the passage. If a lawyer charges higher rates and is better with money, it can contribute to a lucrative law practice.\nOption G: Higher rates, higher funding - This option aligns with the information provided in the passage. If a lawyer charges higher rates and has higher funding, it can contribute to a lucrative law practice.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best options that contribute to a lucrative law practice are A, B, E, F, and G.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[ABEFG]##.The answer is: [ABEFG]", "\n#### 150\nThe answer is: 150"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "human": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}, "key": "Society_Law_and_Justice/oanc-grants_fail_to_come-1.txt-2"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "History-Anthropology/oanc-HistoryItaly-1.txt", "qid": "13", "passage": ["The Romans: Legend says Rome was founded by Romulus, sired with twin brother Remus by Mars of a Vestal Virgin and abandoned on the Palatine Hill to be suckled by a she-wolf.", "Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c.", "are just about right.", "Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c.", "established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries.", "In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious.", "Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c.", ", the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia.", "All roads did indeed lead to\u2002\u2014\u2002and from\u2002\u2014\u2002Rome.", "By 250 b.c.", ", the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000.", "Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France.", "The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization.", "Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c.", "Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters.", "The Third and final Punic War ended in 149 b.c.", ", though national solidarity was still a long way off.", "Under Julius Caesar, elected in 59 b.c."], "question": {"question": "How long was Rome ruled as a monarchy?", "sentences_used": [1, 3], "answers": [{"text": "233 years", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "390", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "510", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "241", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "243 years", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "13", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0, 0], "real_label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "single_answer": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nHistorians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c.\nUnder Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c.\n\n[Options:]\nA: 233 years\nB: 390\nC: 510\nD: 241\nE: 243 years\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.
