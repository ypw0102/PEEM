Initially, the rate for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation was $25 an hour. However, as of last week, he has increased this rate to a minimum of $50 an hour.\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThe new rate is $50 an hour, which corresponds to option A.\nThe old rate was $25 an hour, which is mentioned in option D.\nOptions B ($400) and C ($150) are not mentioned anywhere in the passage and are therefore irrelevant to the context provided.\n\nGiven the details in the passage, the correct answers that align with the raised rates and the original rates are A and D.\nSo, The answer is:##[AD]##\n\n\nSample2:\n[Passages:]\nLucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird.\nShe draws a picture of her family.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Martha\nB: Lucy\n\n[Analyses:]\nAnalyzing the provided passages gives us key information about the central figure in the narrative:\n\nLucy is identified as an eight-year-old girl.\nIt's stated that Lucy lives with her parents and a pet bird.\nLucy engages in an activity where she draws a picture of her family.\nGiven this context, the task requires selecting appropriate answers from the options A (Martha) and B (Lucy).

This breakdown is a logical interpretation based on the information provided.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the passage and the various possible interpretations, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[ABC]##", "To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage:\n\nThe passage mentions a man and a woman sitting in front of a stove.\nThe man is described as a tall, repulsive-looking creature, and his age is estimated to be around fifty.\nThe man who came home gives a few words of explanation and tells Babette to be seated.\nThe youngest son produces bottles of wine and spirits.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\nThere are at least 3 people in the house: the man who came home, the woman sitting in front of the stove, and Babette.\nThe passage also mentions a youngest son who produces bottles of wine and spirits.\n\nGiven these details, the correct answer is that there are at least 4 people in the house: the man who came home, the woman sitting in front of the stove, Babette, and the youngest son. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if the mother is the same person as the woman sitting in front of the stove, so we cannot definitively say there are 5 people in the house.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg-10020.txt-8"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Society_Law_and_Justice/oanc-Bias_on_the_Job-2.txt", "qid": "7", "passage": ["Women and minorities appear to be benefiting from greater employment opportunities in the United States, but discrimination remains a significant problem, according to a study to be released today by two professors at the Rutgers School of Law in Newark.", "The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999.", "Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms.", "The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G.

Again, the passage does not mention leaving at noon or the number of sandwiches, so this option is not supported.\n\nOption C states that they would leave at 10 and take sandwiches with them. This aligns with the information provided in the passage, where Mom told Sam they would leave when the big hand is pointing to the 10. However, the passage does not mention anything about the number of sandwiches they took, so we cannot confirm or reject this part of the option.\n\nOption D states that they left at ten and took three sandwiches with them. This aligns with the information provided in the passage, where Mom told Sam they would leave when the big hand is pointing to the 10. However, the passage does not mention anything about the number of sandwiches they took, so we cannot confirm or reject this part of the option.\n\nBased on the information provided, the only option that aligns with the given details is option C, which states that they would leave at 10 and take sandwiches with them.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passages to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passage mentions the following key information:\n- Mom told Sam that they would leave when the big hand on the clock was pointing to the 10, and the little hand was pointing to the 12.\n- Mom asked Sam if he would like to help make sandwiches for the trip, and Sam said that he wanted to help.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n- The phrase \"when the big hand on the clock was pointing to the 10, and the little hand was pointing to the 12\" indicates that they would leave at 10 o'clock.\n- Sam agreed to help make sandwiches for the trip.\n\nGiven these details, we can now analyze the options:\n- Option A states that they left at noon and took four sandwiches with them. However, the passage clearly states that they would leave at 10 o'clock, not at noon. Additionally, there is no information about the number of sandwiches taken.\n- Option B states that they left at noon and took three sandwiches with them. Again, this contradicts the information in the passage about leaving at 10 o'clock.\n- Option C states that they would leave at 10 and take sandwiches with them. This aligns with the information in the passage about leaving at 10 o'clock and making sandwiches for the trip.\n- Option D states that they left at ten and took three sandwiches with them. This aligns with the information in the passage about leaving at 10 o'clock, but there is no information about the number of sandwiches taken.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer that aligns with leaving at 10 o'clock and making sandwiches for the trip is C.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 0, 0], "predicts": [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 1, 1]}, "key": "Fiction-stories/mctest-mc160.train.64-0.txt-18"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "wikiMovieSummaries-2444093.txt", "qid": "16", "passage": ["In 2415 , after a virus in 2011 wiped out 99 % of the Earth's population , all of the survivors inhabit Bregna , a walled city-state , Which is ruled by a congress of scientists .", "Although Bregna is idyllic , people are routinely disappearing and everyone is suffering from bad dreams .", "on Flux is a member of the ` Monicans ' , an underground rebel organization who communicate through telepathy-enabling technology and are led by The Handler .", "After a mission to destroy a surveillance station , on comes home to find her sister Una has been killed for being mistaken for a Monican .", "When on is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader , Trevor Goodchild , she discovers that both she and the Monicans are being manipulated by council members in a secret coup .", "This discovery causes on to question the origins of everyone in Bregna ; and in particular , her own personal connection to Trevor .", "It turns out that everyone in Bregna is actually a clone , grown from recycled DNA .", "With the dead constantly being reborn into new individuals and still bearing partial memories of their previous lives , there has been an increase in the troubling dreams .", "Recycling and cloning became necessary since the original viral antidote made humans infertile .", "Trevor's ongoing experiments , as with all his clone ancestors , has been trying to reverse the infertility .", "on learns that she is a clone of the original Trevor's wife , Katherine and is the first Katherine clone in over 400 years .", "One of Trevor's experiments , Una , was successful as she became pregnant ."], "question": {"question": "What are possibilities of previous lives?", "sentences_used": [7, 8], "answers": [{"text": "Virus", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Partial memories of their previous lives", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Recycling and Cloning", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Babies", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Dreams are memories", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "DNA", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "16", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 0.75, 0.75, 0, 0.5, 0.25], "real_label": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], "single_answer": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nWith the dead constantly being reborn into new individuals and still bearing partial memories of their previous lives , there has been an increase in the troubling dreams .\nRecycling and cloning became necessary since the original viral antidote made humans infertile .\n\n[Options:]\nA: Virus\nB: Partial memories of their previous lives\nC: Recycling and Cloning\nD: Babies\nE: Dreams are memories\nF: DNA\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The passages do not mention a need for workers due to infertility.\n\nOption D (Secret service) is not supported by the information in the passages. There is no mention of a secret service in the passages.\n\nOption E (Because the original viral antidote made humans infertile and the negative effect was that all the clones had troubling dreams) is partially supported by the information in the passages. It correctly mentions that the viral antidote made humans infertile, but it adds the additional information that all clones had troubling dreams. While the passages mention an increase in troubling dreams, they do not explicitly state that all clones have troubling dreams.\n\nOption F (Virus- the original viral antidote made humans infertile) is supported by the information in the passages. It accurately states that the original viral antidote made humans infertile, which is mentioned in the passages.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer that aligns with the information in the passages is: The answer is:##[F]##", "To answer this reading comprehension question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passages and determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe first passage mentions that the dead are constantly being reborn into new individuals and still bear partial memories of their previous lives. It also mentions an increase in troubling dreams. The second passage states that recycling and cloning became necessary because the original viral antidote made humans infertile.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n- The troubling dreams are a result of the dead being reborn with partial memories of their previous lives.\n- Recycling and cloning became necessary because the original viral antidote made humans infertile.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n- Option A (Virus- they had few humans left) is not mentioned in the passages and is therefore irrelevant.\n- Option B (Virus- they were running out of women) is not mentioned in the passages and is therefore irrelevant.\n- Option C (Infertility- they needed workers) is not mentioned in the passages and is therefore irrelevant.\n- Option D (Secret service) is not mentioned in the passages and is therefore irrelevant.\n- Option E (Because the original viral antidote made humans infertile and the negative effect was that all the clones had troubling dreams) correctly combines the information from both passages and provides an accurate explanation for the troubling dreams.\n- Option F (Virus- the original viral antidote made humans infertile) correctly identifies the cause of human infertility mentioned in the second passage.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passages, the correct answers that align with the cause of infertility and the troubling dreams are E and F.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[EF]##", "To solve this reading comprehension question, we need to carefully analyze the provided passages to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\n\nThe passages mention the following key information:\n1.

Recycling and cloning became necessary due to the original viral antidote making humans infertile.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce the following:\n- The troubling dreams are mentioned in the first sentence, and it is stated that they have increased. This suggests a connection between the troubling dreams and the rebirth of the dead into new individuals.\n- The need for recycling and cloning is mentioned in the second sentence, and it is stated that it became necessary due to the original viral antidote making humans infertile.\n\nConsidering these points, we can conclude that the troubling dreams are a negative effect of the recycling and cloning process, which was necessitated by the original viral antidote making humans infertile.

Additionally, there is no mention of lightning and thunder (option C) in the passage, so this option is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the sound was heard because the shuttle malfunctioned (option B) and not because the narrator heard a bell at the end (option D).\n\nSo, The answer is:##[B]##", "To answer this question, we need to analyze the provided passages and determine the correct answer based on the information given.\nThe passage describes a situation where the narrator is in a space shuttle that malfunctions, causing the airlocks to fail and the air to be sucked away.
