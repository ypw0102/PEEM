This indicates that there were multiple plotters involved in the second plot.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, we can conclude that:\n\nThe first plot involved only one person, Philotas, who failed to alert Alexander. Therefore, the correct answer for the first plot is: B: Two that we know of.\n\nThe second plot involved multiple people, as it was instigated by Alexander's own royal pages.

However, the passage also states that he has been helping senior citizens with their legal needs for the past 20 years, which is not consistent with option H (60 years old).\n\nOption A (80) is not mentioned in the passage, and option B (almost 80) is not a specific age. Option C (79) is also not mentioned in the passage. Option D (70 years old) is not consistent with the statement \"I'm no saint,\" which suggests that he is not a young man. Option E (80) is mentioned in the passage, and option F (20) is not relevant to the context provided.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, the correct answer is G: 80 years old.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[G]##", "The provided passage contains information about attorney Richard M. Smith and his work with senior citizens for the past 20 years. The passage states that he has been helping senior citizens with their legal needs for free, and he is described as \"80-year-old Tallahasseean.\"\n\nFrom the options given, we need to determine the correct age of attorney Richard M. Smith. The options range from 60 to 80 years old. However, the passage specifically mentions that he is 80 years old, which corresponds to option G. Option E is also close, but it is not exactly 80 years old. Options B, C, and D are not mentioned in the passage, and option F is incorrect as it refers to the number of years he has been working, not his age.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[G]##", "The provided passage describes attorney Richard M. Smith, who has been helping senior citizens with their legal needs for the past 20 years. The passage also mentions his age, which is relevant to the context of the story.\n\nThe options given are:\nA: Eighty\nB: Almost 80\nC: 79\nD: 70 years old\nE: 80\nF: 20\nG: 80 years old\nH: 60 years old\n\nFrom the passage, we can deduce that Richard M. Smith is 80 years old, which corresponds to option A. The passage states, \"I'm no saint,\" the 80-year-old Tallahasseean said. This directly refers to his age as 80 years old.\n\nOption B, \"Almost 80,\" is not mentioned in the passage and is therefore irrelevant to the context provided. Option C, 79, is not mentioned in the passage and is also irrelevant. Option D, 70 years old, is not accurate based on the information given in the passage. Option E, 80, is the correct answer, as it is directly mentioned in the passage. Option F, 20, is not relevant to the context of the story. Option G, 80 years old, is the same as option E and is therefore redundant. Option H, 60 years old, is not mentioned in the passage and is therefore irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[E]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Society_Law_and_Justice/oanc-Attorney_gives_his_time-2.txt-0"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Science-textbook/science-g3-9.txt", "qid": "3", "passage": ["What causes a change in motion?", "The application of a force.", "Any time an object changes motion, a force has been applied.", "In what ways can this happen?", "Force can cause an object at rest to start moving.", "Forces can cause objects to speed up or slow down.", "Forces can cause a moving object to stop.", "Forces can also cause a change in direction.", "In short, forces cause changes in motion.", "The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both.", "We know that changes in motion require a force.", "We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion.", "How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things.", "It depends on the strength of the force.", "It also depends on the objects mass.", "Think about some simple tasks you may regularly do.", "You may pick up a baseball.", "This requires only a very small force."], "question": {"question": "What factors cause changes in motion of a moving object?", "sentences_used": [9, 8], "answers": [{"text": "Shape of the object", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Mass of the object", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The object's mass", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The object's speed, direction, or both speed and direction", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Strength of the force applied", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "The application of force", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Who is applying the force", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "3", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 0.75, 0.5, 0, 0.75, 1, 0.25], "real_label": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "single_answer": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nThe moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both.\nIn short, forces cause changes in motion.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Shape of the object\nB: Mass of the object\nC: The object's mass\nD: The object's speed, direction, or both speed and direction\nE: Strength of the force applied\nF: The application of force\nG: Who is applying the force\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

The options are:\nA (The commercial end of the game), B (Baseball), C (Southern Association), D (The pastime), E (Just do not cheat), and F (Basketball).\n\nThe passage does not mention the commercial end of the game or basketball, so options A and F are irrelevant. Option D (The pastime) is not a specific term and could be interpreted in different ways, so it is not the best choice. Option C (Southern Association) is the most relevant choice, as it directly relates to the topic of the passage.

Option A (It is always a push) is incorrect because the passage mentions that gravity is a pull, not a push. Option B (It keeps planets orbiting around the sun and the moon from flying into space) is not directly related to the description of gravity as an invisible force that pulls down objects. Option C (It is a push or pull) is also incorrect because the passage specifically states that gravity is a pull. Option D (It moves things) is also incorrect because the passage mentions that gravity pulls objects down.

The options are: A (drug dealers), B (drugs), C (kidnappers), D (weapons), and E (payment).\n\nThe passage mentions that the organization decided not to move forward with the murder plot, which eliminates option A (drug dealers) as the correct answer. Option B (drugs) is also not relevant to the context provided. Option C (kidnappers) is not mentioned in the passage, so it is not a valid answer. Option D (weapons) is directly related to the information given in the passage, as Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Option E (payment) is also relevant, as Mata received a payment for setting up meetings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers that align with the information provided in the passage are D (weapons) and E (payment).\n\nThe answer is:##[DE]##", "The provided passage contains information about a (organization) and its decision not to move forward with a murder plot. The statement also mentions that Mata received a payment for setting up meetings.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nOption E (Payment) is also related to the context of the passage, as it mentions that Mata received a payment for setting up meetings. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n\nSo, The answer is:##[D, E]##", "The provided passage contains information about a (organization) and its decision not to move forward with a murder plot.

Option C (kidnappers) is also not mentioned in the passage.\n\nOption D (weapons) is mentioned in the context of Mata using his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Option E (payment) is also mentioned in the passage, as the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, the correct answer(s) are D (weapons) and E (payment).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[DE]##", "The provided passage contains information about a situation involving an organization, a payment, and the involvement of weapons. To determine the correct answer(s), we need to analyze the passage carefully and identify the relevant details.\n\nThe passage states that the organization ultimately decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings. This indicates that the payment was made to Mata for his role in arranging the meetings, which is related to the situation involving the organization.\n\nRegarding the involvement of weapons, the passage mentions that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers.

Option E is also incorrect because the passage mentions that Rome was a monarchy until 510 B.C., not 243 years after the founding date.\n\nOption B (390) is incorrect because the passage states that Rome was a monarchy under Etruscan domination until 510 B.C., not 390 years after the founding date.\n\nOption C (510) is the correct answer because the passage mentions that Rome was a monarchy until a revolt in 510 B.C.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[C]##"], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}, "key": "History-Anthropology/oanc-HistoryItaly-1.txt-13"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "News/CNN/cnn-3aad69ac9173d0db3e5f477b85d4a2ae8b26d019.txt", "qid": "9", "passage": ["(OPRAH.com) -- Chris Rock is an Emmy-winning comedian, devoted husband and loving father --but it's time to get to know a new side of this funnyman.", "Meet Chris Rock, hair expert.", "It's a detour he took after an innocent carpool ride left Rock with an idea he just couldn't shake.", "\"I was with my daughter one day, and we're in the car and she's with one of her friends in the back seat, a little white friend,\" he says.", "\"She was just kind of raving about her friend's hair a little too much for my comfort [saying]: 'You've got great hair.", "Oh, your hair's so good.'\" Not wanting to make her comments a big deal, Rock says he tried to play his them off.", "\"[I said]: \"Oh, baby, your hair's beautiful.", "Come on,'\" he says.", "\"If I would have really reacted, then she would have a complex about her hair.\"", "Still, Rock couldn't let it go.", "\"It sparked something in me,\" he says.", "Oprah.com: Oprah's hair throughout the years!", "What Rock discovered is a $9 billion industry that affects the daily activities, wallets, self-esteem -- and even the sex lives -- of black women.", "Because women spend so much time and money on their hair, Rock says men are forced to adopt a hands-off policy.", "\"You cannot touch a black woman's hair.", "You are conditioned not to even go there,\" he says.", "\"When I was a dating guy, I dated women from different races.", "Anytime I was with an Asian or a Puerto Rican girl or a white girl, my hands would constantly be in their hair."], "question": {"question": "Why can't you touch a black woman's hair?", "sentences_used": [12, 13, 14], "answers": [{"text": "Hair products for black women make their hair extremely brittle", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Condtioned", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because of the time and money she's put into it", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Hair Cut", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Due to allergy reasons", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because of the ingredients in hair products", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Women Spent lots of Money", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Because women spend so much time and money on their hair, thus man are forced to adopt a hands-off policy", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}], "idx": "9", "multisent": true}, "avg_label": [0, 0.25, 0.75, 0, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.5], "real_label": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "single_answer": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nWhat Rock discovered is a $9 billion industry that affects the daily activities, wallets, self-esteem -- and even the sex lives -- of black women.\nBecause women spend so much time and money on their hair, Rock says men are forced to adopt a hands-off policy.\n\"You cannot touch a black woman's hair.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Hair products for black women make their hair extremely brittle\nB: Condtioned\nC: Because of the time and money she's put into it\nD: Hair Cut\nE: Due to allergy reasons\nF: Because of the ingredients in hair products\nG: Women Spent lots of Money\nH: Because women spend so much time and money on their hair, thus man are forced to adopt a hands-off policy\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

Option F is incorrect because the passage states that the President of the United States does not create the official title for the head of the U.S. intelligence community, but rather the National Security Act of 1947 created the position of DCI.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[A]##", "The provided passage contains information about the National Security Act of 1947 and the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).
