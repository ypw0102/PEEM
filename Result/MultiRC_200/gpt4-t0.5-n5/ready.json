While it does include information that is mentioned in the passage (Alexander marching west into Illyria, defeating the two rulers, and securing his northern frontier), it also includes additional information (\"This victory allowed him to secure his northern frontier\") that is not explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are: The answer is:##[BEG]##.", "The passage describes a historical event involving Alexander:\n\nAlexander hears news of a revolt against his authority by Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti.\nIn response, Alexander marches west into Illyria and defeats each king in turn, causing them to flee with their troops.\nAs a result of these victories, he secures his northern frontier.\nGiven this information, we need to select the appropriate options that align with the events described in the passage. The options are: A (Headed north), B (Marched west), C (Gave up), D (He marched west into Illyria and defeated each, forcing the two rules to flee with their troops. This victory allowed him to secure his northern frontier), E (Defeated both), F (Accepted their revolt), and G (Made them flee).\n\nOption B (Marched west) directly matches the action taken by Alexander as described in the passage. Option D (He marched west into Illyria and defeated each, forcing the two rules to flee with their troops. This victory allowed him to secure his northern frontier) is a direct quote from the passage and accurately summarizes the events. Option E (Defeated both) and G (Made them flee) also accurately reflect the outcomes of Alexander's actions.\n\nOption A (Headed north) is incorrect because the passage states that Alexander marched west, not north. Option C (Gave up) is also incorrect as Alexander did not give up but instead took action against the revolt. Option F (Accepted their revolt) is incorrect because Alexander did not accept the revolt but fought against it.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answers are B, D, E, and G.

The Greeks believed this, but it is not said that Alexander himself thought this.\n\nOption F: \"Attempting to introduce proskynesis\" is accurate, as the passage mentions Alexander adopting this practice and it being a cause for his loss of sympathies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are: The answer is:##[ADF]##."], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], "predicts": [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]], "human": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}, "key": "Wiki_articles/wikiAlexander the Great-34.txt-3"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Sept11-reports/oanc-chapter-3-2.txt", "qid": "21", "passage": ["The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).", "Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities.", "The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA.", "As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources.", "The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations.", "Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA.", "The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet.", "The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited.", "He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress.", "This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises.", "Neither is true.", "In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense.", "Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs.", "As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements."], "question": {"question": "Is it true that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises?", "sentences_used": [9, 10, 11], "answers": [{"text": "No", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Yes", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Yes, this is true", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "No it is not true.

Option C suggests a possible scenario where there are five people in the house: the man who came home, the man and woman sitting over something, Babette, and the son. The mother could be the same person as the woman sitting over something, but this is not specified in the passage.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the passage, both options B and C could be correct. Therefore, the answer is:##[BC]##", "The passage describes a scene involving several characters:\n\n1. A man and a woman sitting over something. The man is described in detail.\n2. A man who had come home, who seems to be in a position of authority.\n3. Babette, who is told to sit down.\n4. The youngest son, who brings out a bottle of wine and spirits.\n5. The man's mother, who is told to get some supper.\n\nGiven these descriptions, we can infer that there are at least four distinct individuals mentioned: the unkempt man, the man who came home, Babette, and the youngest son. The woman sitting with the unkempt man could potentially be the mother, but this is not confirmed in the text. Therefore, we cannot definitively say there are only three people (option A) or exactly five people (option C).\n\nHowever, we can confidently say that there are at least four people mentioned in the house (option B), as this is supported by the text and does not make assumptions about the identities of the characters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:##[B]##."], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]], "human": [0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg-10020.txt-8"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Society_Law_and_Justice/oanc-Bias_on_the_Job-2.txt", "qid": "7", "passage": ["Women and minorities appear to be benefiting from greater employment opportunities in the United States, but discrimination remains a significant problem, according to a study to be released today by two professors at the Rutgers School of Law in Newark.", "The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999.", "Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms.", "The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G.

Option E (Between 30 and 40) is also correct, as it is another way of expressing the age range of someone in their 30s.\n\nOn the other hand, Option C (Younger than thirty) is incorrect because the victim is said to be in his 30s, not younger than 30. Similarly, Option D (At least 50) is also incorrect as it suggests an age range that is older than the one provided in the passage.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answers are: The answer is:##[ABE]##.", "In this passage, we are given specific information about the age of a victim involved in an incident:\n\nThe police stated that the victim was in his 30s.\nThe victim has not been identified, and efforts are being made to contact his next of kin.\nGiven the context, we need to select the option(s) that directly relate to the information provided in the passage.

This directly corresponds to options A and B, both of which indicate the same age range. The other options (C, D, and E) do not accurately reflect the information provided in the passage. Option C suggests the victim was younger than thirty, which contradicts the passage. Option D suggests the victim was at least fifty, which also contradicts the passage. Option E suggests the victim was between thirty and forty, which is not necessarily incorrect, but it is less precise than options A and B, which exactly match the phrasing used in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are: The answer is:##[AB]##", "The passage provides information about the age of a person who was pronounced dead at the scene.

A teacher, a prince, and a philosopher are unlikely to be conducting rounds and carrying keys to heavy doors. A policeman could potentially fit, but there is no mention of law enforcement or crime in the passage. A wine maker could potentially have access to cellars, but the passage does not mention wine or production.\n\nThe roles that seem most likely based on the passage are a keeper, a guard, or a security guard, as these roles would involve conducting rounds and potentially having access to secure areas like cellars. However, the passage does not provide definitive evidence to confirm any of these roles. The individual could also potentially be a homeowner or a caretaker, roles not listed in the options.\n\nGiven the lack of definitive evidence in the passage to confirm any of the roles listed in the options, the most accurate answer is F (It's unclear). \n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[F]##.", "The passage describes a person's actions and responsibilities, but does not explicitly identify their profession or role.

They reassure themselves that the cellars are safe, indicating they are responsible for the house's security.\n5. They carry the key to the cellar's heavy oaken door, further supporting the idea of a security role.\n\nGiven these clues, the person's role could be a keeper (D), a guard (G), or a security guard (H). The other options (A: A teacher, B: A prince, C: A policeman, E: Wine maker, I: A philosopher) do not align with the duties described in the passage.

They carry the key to this door on their person at all times.\nGiven these clues, the person seems to have a role related to maintaining or overseeing a property, as suggested by their access to the cellars and their early morning 'round'.\n\nThe options are: A (A teacher), B (A prince), C (A policeman), D (A keeper), E (Wine maker), F (It's unclear), G (Guard), H (Security guard), and I (A philosopher).\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the roles of a teacher, prince, policeman, wine maker, and philosopher do not align with the actions described. The roles of a keeper, guard, or security guard could potentially fit, as these roles often involve overseeing property and conducting rounds to ensure everything is secure.\n\nHowever, the passage does not provide specific information to definitively identify the person's role. Therefore, while options D, G, and H could potentially fit, the most accurate answer based on the information available is F (It's unclear).\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[F]##", "The passage describes a first-person account of someone who leaves a tower at dawn, has to use a light because the house is still dark, and carries a key to a heavy oaken door that leads to the cellars.

The options A (A teacher), B (A prince), E (Wine maker), and I (A philosopher) do not align with the context provided in the passage. A teacher or a philosopher would not typically be described as going on a 'round' or carrying keys to a heavy door leading to cellars. A prince might live in a tower but would not typically be described in this way either. A wine maker could potentially have access to cellars, but the context of the 'round' and the key to a heavy door suggests more of a security role.\n\nOptions C (A policeman), D (A keeper), G (Guard), and H (Security guard) are all plausible based on the context, but a policeman would not typically be associated with a tower or cellars, and a guard or security guard might not carry a key as they are usually responsible for guarding rather than accessing different areas.\n\nOption D (A keeper) seems to be the most fitting as a keeper could be responsible for the upkeep and security of a place, including going on rounds, carrying keys, and having access to all areas, including cellars.\n\nOption F (It's unclear) could also be considered correct as the passage does not explicitly state the person's role.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[DF]##", "The passage provides information about an individual who is making a 'round in a house, carrying a light due to the early hour.

This could suggest roles such as a keeper, guard, or security guard (options D, G, H).\n\nHowever, there is no specific mention of the individual's profession or role in the passage, making it difficult to definitively choose one of these options. The passage does not provide enough information to associate the individual with being a teacher, prince, policeman, wine maker, or philosopher (options A, B, C, E, I).\n\nGiven the lack of explicit information about the individual's role, the most accurate choice would be option F (It's unclear), as this reflects the ambiguity in the passage.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[F]##."], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]], "human": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}, "key": "Fiction/gutenberg-10002.txt-12"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction/gutenberg-10002.txt", "qid": "14", "passage": ["The day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of the study candles with me on my 'round.", "By the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.", "My search had shown me nothing fresh.", "Everything appeared to be in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars.", "I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty search on the evening of the attack.", "For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated.", "I would have been very willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the cellars are the hugest and weirdest.", "Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.", "Yet, I would not shirk the work.", "I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.", "Besides, as I reassured myself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which to come across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered, only through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, I carry always on my person."], "question": {"question": "What was he doing on the ground floor?", "sentences_used": [0, 1], "answers": [{"text": "Reading", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Sleeping", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Searching", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Making his rounds", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Cooking", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Looking for the key to the cellar", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Cleaning", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "14", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "real_label": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "single_answer": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nThe day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of the study candles with me on my 'round.\nBy the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.\n\n[Options:]\nA: Reading\nB: Sleeping\nC: Searching\nD: Making his rounds\nE: Cooking\nF: Looking for the key to the cellar\nG: Cleaning\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

Option F also aligns with the information in the passage, as the conversion of potential energy into motion is essentially the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy. \n\nOptions A and D are not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While it's implied that the leaf has energy (potential energy), the passage does not specifically state that the leaf \"gets\" energy or \"gives off\" motion energy.

This corresponds with options C (Leaf's energy is turned into motion) and F (Potential energy is turned into kinetic energy), as kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Option E (They gain kinetic energy) could also be considered correct, as the leaf gains kinetic energy when its potential energy is transformed into motion as it falls.\n\nOptions A (They get energy) and D (They give off motion energy) are not directly supported by the passages.

The options are: A (They get energy), B (They turn colors), C (Leaf's energy is turned into motion), D (They give off motion energy), E (They gain kinetic energy), and F (Potential energy is turned into kinetic energy).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention that the leaves are gaining energy. Option B is irrelevant as there is no mention of leaves changing color. Option C is correct because it directly aligns with the information in the passage about the leaf's energy being turned into motion. Option D is incorrect because the passage does not mention that the leaves are giving off motion energy.

For instance, options A (Spent on overhead) and B (She spent it on overhead) contradict the passage, which clearly states that no money was spent on overhead. Option D (She did not want to say why) is irrelevant as there's no indication in the passage that Mintie was hesitant to explain anything. Option F (It was stolen) is also irrelevant as the passage does not suggest any theft. Option H (It does not say) is vague and does not specify what it is referring to.

The other options, such as bed time (B), midnight (C), when he finished searching the cellar (D), when he entered the cellar (F), and around noon (I), are not mentioned or implied in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are: The answer is:##[AEH]##.", "The provided passage describes a sequence of events that occur at different times of the day. The key pieces of information are:\n\nThe protagonist begins his 'round at break of dawn, as the day was just breaking. This corresponds to options E and G.\nHe finishes searching the ground floor when daylight is creeping in through the windows. This could be interpreted as early morning, corresponding to option H.\nThe protagonist contemplates having another look around the cellars just as he is about to extinguish his candle. The specific time of this event is not stated. Therefore, options A, D, and F could be possible but are not explicitly supported by the text.\nOptions B (Bed time), C (Midnight), and I (Around noon) are not mentioned in the passage and do not align with the sequence of events described.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answers are E, G, and H.

Since the passage directly mentions Lucy as the subject who is actively involved in the described activities, and there is no mention of Martha, the logical conclusion based on the passages is to select Lucy as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, The answer is:##[B]##\n\n\nSample3:\n[Passages:]\nAt the equator, the seasons never change.\nAs a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same.\n\n[Options:]\nA: The equator.\nB: Australia\nC: North pole\nD: New York\n\n[Analyses:]\nThe provided passage gives specific information about the climatic conditions at the equator:\n\nThe seasons at the equator do not change.\nConsequently, the average daily temperatures remain constant throughout the year.\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage.

However, the action of touching his sleeve is immediately followed by the statement \"The judge is coming.\" This suggests that the action of touching his sleeve could be a signal or gesture to indicate the arrival of the judge.

This suggests that the action of touching the sleeve was to get his attention before conveying the information about the judge's arrival. \n\nOption D (To tell him the judge was coming) is also a valid answer as it directly aligns with the information given in the passage. The person touches the sleeve and then informs about the judge's arrival.\n\nOptions A (To dust it off) and B (To pull him closer) are not supported by the context provided in the passage.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answers are: The answer is:##[CD]##", "The given passage describes a scene where someone stands up and touches his sleeve, then communicates that \"The judge is coming.\" Following this, Mr. Thorndike sits down. \n\nGiven this context, we need to select the appropriate option(s) that directly relate to the information given in the passage. The options are: A (To dust it off), B (To pull him closer), C (To get his attention), and D (To tell him the judge was coming).\n\nThe passage does not provide explicit information as to why the person touched his sleeve. However, the phrase \"The judge is coming\" immediately follows this action, suggesting that the touching of the sleeve was a signal or a way to communicate this message. Therefore, option D (To tell him the judge was coming) seems to be the most plausible answer. \n\nThe other options, A (To dust it off), B (To pull him closer), and C (To get his attention), are not directly supported by the information given in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the information provided, is: The answer is:##[D]##", "The passage provides the following details:\n\nA person stands up and touches another person's sleeve.\nThe statement \"The judge is coming\" is made.\nMr. Thorndike sits down.\nThe options provided are: A (To dust it off), B (To pull him closer), C (To get his attention), and D (To tell him the judge was coming).\n\nThe passage does not provide explicit information about why the person touched the other's sleeve. However, the sequence of events suggests that the touch was likely to communicate that \"The judge is coming,\" which is stated immediately after the touch. Therefore, option D (To tell him the judge was coming) is a plausible interpretation of the text.\n\nThe other options, such as dusting off the sleeve (A), pulling him closer (B), or getting his attention (C), could be possible reasons for touching the sleeve, but the passage does not provide any direct evidence to support these interpretations.\n\nBased on the reasoning, the correct answer is: The answer is:##[D]##."], "ans_pre_human": {"answer": [0, 0, 1, 1], "predicts": [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]], "human": [0, 0, 1, 0]}, "key": "Fiction-stories-masc-A_Wasted_Day-5.txt-0"}, {"raw_data": {"meta": {"pid": "Fiction/mctest-mc160.test.12-0.txt", "qid": "3", "passage": ["Susan wanted to have a birthday party.", "She called all of her friends.", "She has five friends.", "Her mom said that Susan can invite them all to the party.", "Her first friend could not go to the party because she was sick.", "Her second friend was going out of town.", "Her third friend was not so sure if her parents would let her.", "The fourth friend said maybe.", "The fifth friend could go to the party for sure.", "Susan was a little sad.", "On the day of the party, all five friends showed up.", "Each friend had a present for Susan.", "Susan was happy and sent each friend a thank you card the next week."], "question": {"question": "How many people did Susan call?", "sentences_used": [1, 2], "answers": [{"text": "5", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "Five", "isAnswer": true, "scores": {}}, {"text": "6", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}, {"text": "All of her firends", "isAnswer": false, "scores": {}}], "idx": "3", "multisent": false}, "avg_label": [1, 1, 0, 0.75], "real_label": [1, 1, 0, 0], "single_answer": [1, 1, 0, 1], "inputs": "[Passages:]\nShe called all of her friends.\nShe has five friends.\n\n[Options:]\nA: 5\nB: Five\nC: 6\nD: All of her firends\n"}, "prompt": "You are an expert in the field of reading comprehension.\nYour task is to select one or more appropriate answers from given options based on certain text paragraphs provided to you.\n\nYou need to first present the reasoning process and base your answers on that reasoning.\nWhen providing the final answer, please follow the format: The answer is:##[right options]##\n(e.g., The answer is:##[BD]##)\n\nSample1:\n[Passages:]\nHoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates.\nAs of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation.\n\n[Options:]\nA: $50\nB: $400\nC: $150\nD: $25\n\n[Analyses:]\nTo solve this reading comprehension question, we need to analyze the provided passage carefully to determine the correct answer(s) from the options given.\nThe passage mentions that the individual had to raise his rates because the hoped-for federal grants didn't come through.

This directly corresponds to option A and C. It also mentions that the DCI is independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, which corresponds to option E. Option B and D are incorrect because they mention incorrect years for the National Security Act. Option F and G are also incorrect because the passage does not mention the President of the United States or suggest that the president created the official title for the head of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers, based on the information provided, are: The answer is:##[ACE]##", "The passage provides information about the creation of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) position:\n\nThe National Security Act of 1947 is specifically mentioned as the act that created the position of DCI.

This corresponds to options B and F, which explicitly mention this formula. Option E (How far something travels) and option A (How long it takes to travel that far) are also correct because they refer to the distance and time, respectively, which are required to calculate speed according to the formula given in the passage.\n\nOptions C (Using a speedometer), D (Multiplying distance by time), and G (Multiplying miles by the time) are incorrect because they do not align with the information provided in the passage.
